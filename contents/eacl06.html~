Call for Bids to Host EACL 2006

The European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics
(EACL) hereby invites proposals to host the tri-annual conference of
the European Chapter of ACL in 2006. This conference will be the 11th
meeting of the EACL.

At this time, we seek draft proposals from prospective bidders. Based
on an evaluation of the draft proposals received, promising bidders
will be asked to provide additional information as needed for the
final selection.

The EACL Board will select the Program Committee Chair and all other
Chairs for the conference (e.g., Tutorial Chair, Demo Chair,
Publications Chair, Student Co-Chairs), except the Local Arrangements
Chair.

Draft proposals should identify a Local Arrangements Chair, who will
be responsible for activities such as arranging meeting rooms,
equipment, refreshments, accommodation, on-site registration, 
participant
e-mail access, security for equipment, the reception, the banquet, and
working with the other Chairs and the EACL Board to develop the budget
and registration materials.

Draft proposals are due on February 15, 2004. They will be evaluated
by the EACL Board by April 1, 2004. Promising bidders will then be
contacted and asked to provide further information due by May 15,
2004. The final bid will be chosen in July 2004.

The conference should take place during April 2006, avoiding national
holidays of the EACL countries (in 2006, western easter is April 16,
orthodox easter is April 23, Jewish passover is April 13-20).

Draft proposals should include information on:

     * Location (accessibility; conference venue, e.g., hotel or
       university; accommodations, e.g., hotels, motels, student dorms)
     * Proposed dates
     * Local Arrangements team (chair/co-chair, committee, volunteer
       labor, registration handling)
     * Local Computational Linguistics community

     * A/V equipment
     * Food/entertainment/banquet/receptions

     * Budget estimates
     * Opportunities for co-location with other meetings.

criteria (unordered):

       anticipated number of registrants
     * Adequacy of residence accommodations and food services in a range 
of

       Toulouse (ACL 2001), Budapest (EACL 2003), Geneva (Coling 2004)
       and Barcelona (ACL 2004).
     * Experience of local arrangements team
