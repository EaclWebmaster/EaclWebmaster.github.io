<h2>Call Text</h2>

<p>
The European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL) invites
proposals to host the 2017 EACL conference, to be held in Europe, the Middle East or
Africa (EMEA) in Spring (preferably April) 2017. From 2014 the EACL conference
takes place every 3 years. The 2017 conference will be the 15th meeting of the EACL.
</p>

<p>
We seek draft proposals from prospective bidders. Based on an evaluation of the
draft proposals received, promising bidders will be asked to provide additional
information for the final selection.
</p>

<p>
The EACL Board will appoint the general chair for the conference, the programme
committee co-chairs, and all other chairs (tutorial co-chairs, workshop co-chairs,
etc.) except for the local arrangements chair.
</p>

<p>
Draft proposals should identify a local arrangements chair, who will be responsible
for activities such as arranging meeting rooms, equipment, refreshments,
accommodation, on-site registration, participant internet access, the reception, the
conference dinner, and working with the other chairs and the EACL Board to develop
the budget and registration materials. Achieving budget estimates will, in
particular, involve liaising with the sponsorship committee.
</p>

The conference should take place during Spring 2017 (preferably April), avoiding
national holidays of the EACL countries such as Western and Orthodox Easter and
Jewish passover.
