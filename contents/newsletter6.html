<h2>EDITORIAL</h2>

<p> 

It is a great pleasure to edit the EACL newsletter for the first time.
I would like to start by expressing many thanks to the previous
editor, Gertjan van Noord, for all his work over the past two years.
He contributes to this issue, in his new capacity as Chair of EACL.
Other contributions in this edition include a report on ACL 2004 from
Toni Badia, who chaired the local organising committee; a report on
the Israeli Seminar on Computational Linguistics (ISCOL-2004) by Ido
Dagan; a word about EACL sponsorship from our new EACL secretary
Anette Frank and the treasurer Mike Rosner; and an announcement about
EACL 2006.  Last but definitely not least, this newsletter includes a
calendar of upcoming events in computational linguistics.  Thanks to
Leonoor van der Beek for all her efforts in keeping this calendar up
to date.  </p>

<p> I would be grateful to receive any contributions for future
editions of the newsletter on any matters of interest to EACL members.
Please email them to <tt>newsletter@eacl.org</tt>.  And I look forward to
seeing you during this summer's conference season, especially at Ann
Arbor in June.  </p>

<h2>FROM THE CHAIR</h2>

<p>
The EACL board has undergone quite a few changes. We are very thankful
for the time and effort that our leaving board members have spent on
EACL.  John Carroll has been the EACL secretary for many years
and did a wonderful job. Claire Gardent has been the chair over the
last two years and, among other things, was responsible for the
Budapest EACL event, one of the most successful EACL meetings in
history. Finally, we will miss Hans Uszkoreit's creative contributions
and advice. Claire, John, and Hans: many thanks!
</p>

<p>
We have three new board members, whom I would like to welcome. Anette
Frank (from Saarbrücken) will take over from John as our new
secretary.  Alex Lascarides (Edinburgh) is our new chair-elect. So she
will be the EACL chair in 2007 and 2008. Paola Merlo (Geneva) is our
third new member.  Yes. The feminine influence in EACL is quite
obvious. Five out of eight board members, half of the nominating
committee and another majority in the EACL student board! 
</p>

<h2>REPORT ON ACL 2004</h2>

<p>
ACL-04 took place in Barcelona July 21-26, 2004, organised by a
committee of researchers from the five universities in the
Barcelona area which have active research groups on Computational
Linguistics (Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Universitat de
Barcelona, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Universitat Pompeu
Fabra, and Universitat Ramon Llull).
</p>

<p>
The main conference included 18 sessions covering most of the areas in
the field, ranging from multimodal and situated language processing to
evaluation of machine translation.  In addition there were three
"Demonstration and interactive poster" sessions and the Student
Research Workshop. On the last two days of ACL-04 11 workshops were
organised and successfully attended.  At the final count we had 682
registered attendees, taking into account both the main conference and
the workshops.
</p>

<p>
The Lifetime Achievement Award was bestowed upon Karen Spark Jones who
has worked on automatic language and information processing research
since the late 1950s. Over the last decade her work has been on
document retrieval including speech applications, database query, user
and agent modelling, automatic summarisation, and information and
language system evaluation.
</p>

<p>
ACL-04 took place in the Barcelona International Convention Centre
within the premises of the 2004 Forum of Cultures. The Forum organised
a daily programme of cultural events and entertainment options, which
proved to be of great interest to ACL-04 participants.
</p>

<p>
Finally, a word on sponsorship. We reached a record amount of
sponsorship contributions this year: 95,500 euros (approximately
$116,000), of which ca. 63,000 euros came from the 2004 Forum of
Cultures -- probably our largest-ever single contributor. We are
enormously grateful for the generosity of all companies and
institutions that contributed, as sponsors, to the success of ACL-04,
including the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation,
Comprendium, Microsoft, Xerox Europe, and Daedalus.

<h2>ISCOL'04: Israeli Seminar on Computational Linguistics<br><tt>(http://cs.haifa.ac.il/~shuly/iscol)</tt>
</h2>

<p>
The annual meeting of the Israeli Seminar on Computational Linguistics
was held on December 27, 2004 at Bar Ilan University. This year we
were honoring Prof. Yaacov Choueka upon his retirement. The seminar
has been most successful, demonstrating the progress and expansion of
the field in Israel. More than 70 participants attended the event,
including faculty and students from all universities as well as many
people from industrial companies in the NLP, IR and text processing
areas.
</p>

<p>
The program included (see above URL for full program):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Invited talks by Prof. Dan Roth (UIUC, USA) and Prof. Yaacov Choueka
  (Bar-Ilan, Israel)
<li>Presentations of recent products of the Knowledge Center for
  Processing Hebrew (http://www.mila.cs.technion.ac.il/) which were
  developed by several academic groups, including morphological
  analysis and disambiguation (tagging), lexicons and annotated text
  and speech corpora.
<li>Six scientific presentations of language processing research in
  Israel, with topics ranging over morphological analysis (for
  Hebrew), semantic acquisition, discourse triggers and text
  categorization and summarization.
</ul>

<h2>A Word About Sponsorship</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Scale</b>: Each year, the EACL may make available a limited number of
sponsorships, each worth a relatively small amount of
money. Sponsorships are awarded only if the EACL budget allows
it. <br>
In 2004, EACL sponsored two students to attend ESSLLI (Nancy, France),
for approx. 800 Euros each.
<li>
<b>Focus</b>: In awarding sponsorships, EACL focuses on education in
computational linguistics in the geographical area of the
EACL. Priority is given to students from Eastern Europe and more
generally, to students from countries with hard currency problems
(within the geographical area covered by EACL).
<br>
In the past, EACL has sponsored introductory courses at European
summer-schools (in the form of a contribution towards the presenters'
expenses), participation at summer-schools (funding tuition fees and
subsistence expenses for students who would otherwise not have been
able to come) and participation at student workshops at EACL
conferences (contribution towards student-presenters' expenses).
<li>
<b>Visibility</b>: In return for sponsorship, EACL expects some visibility
(for instance, the sponsorship is announced in a workshop programme,
website etc.).  A request for sponsorship must include a
description of the visibility for EACL generated by the sponsorship.
<li>
<b>How to Apply</b>:
A request for sponsorship should identify a concrete purpose. Indeed,
EACL will not sponsor a school or workshop in general, but it will
sponsor a particular course, tutorial, etc., or it will sponsor
participation for a particular group of students etc.
<br>
To prepare a request for sponsorship please consult and follow the
instructions on the EACL pages for sponsorship at <tt>http://www.eacl.org</tt>
(or <tt>http://eacl.coli.uni-saarland.de/Sponsorship.php</tt>).
</ul>

<h2>EACL 2006: Back to Italy</h2>

<p>After more than 20 years, the EACL meeting will once more take place
in Italy. The very first EACL meeting was organised in Pisa back in
1983. In 2006, Trento will host the 11th EACL meeting (for those of
you who have difficulty counting the EACL meetings, please read the
preface to the EACL 2003 Budapest proceedings by Ann Copestake and Jan
Hajic).
</p>

<p>The Programme Co-chairs will be Diana McCarthy (Sussex, UK) and Shuly
Wintner (Haifa, Israel).  The local organisation of the conference
will be carried out by IRST (to be more precise: the Cognitive and
Communication Technology (TCC) Division of ITC-IRST, Centro per la
Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica).  Alberto Lavelli and Bernardo
Magnini will co-chair the local organising committee.  The conference
will take place from April 3 to April 7. The tutorials and workshops
will be held on April 3-4, and the main programme is scheduled for
April 5-7.
</p>

<p>Trento is a nicely located historical city. It is very close to
the Dolomites mountains and to famous cities such as Verona,
Venice, and Milan. The Trento region is said to combine the positive
aspects of both the northern (germanic) and southern (mediterranean)
life styles.  
</p>

<p>
The conference facilities are all located in the centre, and they're
very attractive for EACL. Bars, restaurants and hotels are all
relatively close. The city is not very big, with only 100,000
inhabitants. You can travel to Trento through the international
airports in Verona, Milano or Munich. Trento is on the intercity
connection between Munich and Verona.
</p>

<p>
We hope to welcome many of you in Trento!
