<h2>1. Editorial</h2>

Welcome to the second issue of the EACL Newsletter! In this issue, you
will find more news about the EACL past, present and future activities
as well as the already popular "Views from the Chair". You will also
find a new section which reports on national or European based efforts
to promote NLP and Computational linguistics and in particular, on
national NLP conferences. 

<p>
This time, we have a report by Philippe Blache and Pierre Zweigenbaum
on the French conference "Traitement Automatique des Langues
Naturelles" which, incidentally, takes place this year in Nancy:

<p>
I would like this section to become a regular feature -- so if you are
interested in reporting on a similar event taking place in a european
country, please get in touch with me (<a href="mailto:newsletter@eacl.org">newsletter@eacl.org</a>).

<h2>2. Some views from the chair</h2>

The EACL Board received a number of very appreciative letters from
members on our first Newletter, and we are pleased to bring you the
second in the series. So I'm once again taking this opportunity to
fill you in on what your Board has been up to on your behalf.
<p>

Our main activities over the past months have been focussed on setting
the stage for the next EACL conference, which is scheduled for Spring
of 2003.  We received a range of excellent responses to our call for
bids to host the conference, and the final selection was made in
October. I'm delighted to report that EACL'03 will be held in
Budapest, where our local arrangements Chair will be Professor Ferenc
Kiefer. We are also very grateful to those colleagues at other sites
who also submitted extremely attractive offers.
<p>

Some of you may remember the discussion at the Business Meeting at
EACL'99 in Bergen, where it was decided that we would extend the
format of future EACL conferences, which had up till then been run as
mini-ACLs.  Of course, ACL meetings have themselves changed since
1999, so what we proposed then will not seem so different now.  Our
major impetus for change was the desire to widen the participation in
our meetings to include not only the traditional high-quality (i.e.,
low acceptance rate) theoretical track, but also a more applied track
of "demo-talks" and a session for work-in-progress reports from
national and pan-European projects.  We also want to involve more
closely the many national CL organisations (e.g., ATALA, CLIN, CLIF,
CLUK etc.) and other European organisations in related areas such as
Speech and MT.  In sum, we want EACL conferences to be a gathering of
all European CL researchers and a showcase for the extensive
activities in our field within Europe. We want it to be a conference
that is complemenatary to 'rather than competitive with' the annual
ACL meetings. And we want it to be the sort of conference that we all
plan around rather than just plan for.
<p>

EACL'03 in Budapest will be our first conference with this new format,
and plans for this are already beginning to take shape.  Our
discussions with the other European organisations have resulted in an
almost unanimous agreement by them to collaborate in some way with
EACL'03, possibly through co-located meetings or workshops, or by
organising thematic sessions or panels. The European Commission has
expressed an interest in holding their 2003 meeting of projects in the
area of human language technologies in conjunction with our
conference. We have also been approached by a consortium of EU and
Indian researchers working on NLP-driven multilingual localisation of
software for several Indian languages, who want to hold a workshop in
association with EACL'03.  It's all beginning to look really good. So,
add it to your diary now: Spring 2003, EACL conference, Budapest!!
<p>

Another noteworthy point is that a new EACL constitution was approved by
its members and ratified by the ACL executive committee in July.  The
most significant change to the constitution is the addition of
the position of Chair-elect.  This was introduced to ensure a smooth
hand-over between Chairs.  The Chair-elect will be responsible for
coordinating the planning of the next EACL conference; this means that
at the actual time of the conference, he or she will then be Chair.
<p>

According to the EACL Constitution, the Nominating Committee proposes a
candidate for the position and this information is circulated to all EACL
members, who are given the opportunity to nominate other candidates.  We
are pleased to announce that the Nominating Committee has proposed Claire
Gardent, and that no other nominations were received.  She is therefore
elected unopposed.

<h2>3. EACL News: A new WEB site and a new logo</h2>

The EACL website (<a href="http://www.eacl.org">http://www.eacl.org</a>) has been redesigned by the EACL
student board.  A temporary version (without links) of the new webside
can be found at  
<a href="http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/~gabsdil/eacl-prototype/">http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/~gabsdil/eacl-prototype/</a> 

<p>
The new-look site is easy to navigate and will become a comprehensive
repository of information for the CL community in Europe, North Africa
and the Middle East.

<p>
A section for students is being built, including details of NLP/CL
departments across Europe, summer schools and conferences with student
sessions, links to online courses and broader material to develop
research skills and survive life as a postgraduate.

<p>
Parallel to this will be a collection of resources aimed at all
researchers: the EACL calendar of European and world conferences,
information about national and international professional
organisations and funding bodies, and links for specific areas of CL
such as dialogue, generation and IR.

<p>
The new site will draw upon the expertise and infrastructure developed
under the JEWELS (Joint European Website for Education in Language and
Speech) project. Additionally, a form on the site will invite the
community to submit information about their own departments, projects
and links to further resources.

<h2>4. National CL/NLP Conferences: French T.A.L.N.</h2>

Taking place each year since 1994, TALN (le Traitement Automatique des
Langues Naturelles) is the French-speaking conference on natural
language processing. TALN is a generalist conference that encompasses
all aspects of NLP. The regular conference program is completed with
several tutorials, workshops, invited conferences and demonstration
sessions.  Each year, an average of 40 papers, selected among about 80
submissions, are presented during plenary sessions. Since 1999, a
student session called RECITAL co-occurs with TALN.
<p>

TALN brings together about 120 people. Since it is mainly a
French-speaking conference, its participants primarily come from the
French-speaking area but there is also approximately 15% of
participants that come from other countries.
<p>

In terms of attendance, TALN is thus one of the most successful
national conferences in Europe. Several factors can explain this
success. First, TAL addresses a community exceeding the strict
national frame: the French-speaking world includes France of course
but also Canada, Switzerland, Belgium and North Africa (TALN'2000 was
organized in Switzerland). TALN has thus an international aspect while
at the same time not overlaping with other international conferences
in the field.
<p>

A second promoting factor is the creation some years ago of the TALN
standing committee, in the style of the ESSLLI Standing Board. This
committee chooses two years in advance the site of the conference and
supplies a logistic support for the organizers. The organization
experience grows each year and is passed on to the new
organizers. This facilitates the work and in particular the handling
of the financial aspects: thanks to successful fund raising (both from
institutional and from private sponsors), TALN is self-financed and
registration fees (including acts and meals) can be kept low: 180 Euro
per person and 150 Euro for students.
<p>

The last factor contributing to TALN success is its relations with
other communities. So in 2002 -- and this is an event of great
importance -- TALN is jointly organized with JEP (Journées d'Etude sur
la Parole), the French speaking Speech Processing conference. This
will be the first time that two important conferences in the domain of
speech processing and natural language processing will be organized
jointly. We hope to thus prefigure what could happen in the future at
the European level.

<h2>5. Past Events</h2>

<h3>EACL/ACL'01 in Toulouse</h3>

This year, the joint EACL-ACL meeting in Toulouse had the largest
participation rate ever reached in the ACL history. This is due
to the main conference, but also to the numerous workshops organized 
around it. The total number of registered participants was 621, among
which 156 students. 42 countries were represented: the usual ones were
there, with more than 250 US and about 100 French participants. Some new
countries from the Mediterranean area were represented, while the number
of Eastern-Europe participants remained very low, except for the Czech
Republic. Worth noting also is the high rate of new ACL memberships: 341,
i.e. more than half of the registrations.

<p>
Besides the main conference, 11 workshops and 5 tutorials were
organized.  Workshops were either regular ones (Senseval, EWNLG, HLT,
etc.) or more spontaneous ones (open questions, arabic workshop,
etc.).  553 persons attended a workshop, and 147 a tutorial. One of
the problems with workshop participation was the necessity of
registering also for the main conference, entailing quite high fees
for those attending only a workshop. In spite of a very low
sponsorship level, the conference has a balanced budget, with a small
surplus, helpful for coming ACL activities.

<p>
Workshop and main conference proceedings are now available from the US
ACL office. A CD-Rom contains most of the contributions, except for a
few workshops. It seems that most participants enjoyed the city of
Toulouse: many of them came with their close relatives and children,
and a number stayed in the area after the meeting. Many people enjoyed
the walking tours of the city we organized, and also the excellent
food in the nearby restaurants. The banquet was also much
appreciated. The concert and the impressive architecture of the rooms
balanced a relatively modest quantity of food provided by a deficient
company.  Weather was not as warm and sunny as expected, but that was
probably better for the speakers and the audience.

<h3>ESSLLI'01, Helsinki</h3>


The course `An Introduction to Computational Semantics' lectured by
Patrick Blackburn and Johan Bos, was held at the 13th European Summer
School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI), Helsinki, 13-24
August, 2001 (see <a href="http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/~bos/comsem/esslli.html">http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/~bos/comsem/esslli.html</a>).
The course was sponsored by the EACL, who covered Johan Bos's travel
and accommodation costs.

<p>
The course was a foundational course. That is, it was designed to
cover the basics of the subject in a manner comprehensible to students
from diverse disciplines. For this reason, the course was one of the
few two-week courses offered at the Helsinki ESSLLI: 10 sessions of 90
minutes each were held. Teaching computational semantics involves
introducing the student to a wide range of topics, explaining how they
all fit together, and showing how to turn theory into computational
reality. This is not something that can be rushed.

<p>
The course focussed on two themes: representation and inference. On
the representation side, we covered basic ideas and techniques
(compositionality, lambda-driven semantic construction, treatment of
scope ambiguities), initially in the setting of first-order logic, and
then in the setting of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). We
discussed both the underlying theory and showed how to implement
semantic construction tools in Prolog. On the inference side, we
introduced the basic ideas of logical deduction and related them to
concrete linguistic problems. At the end of the first week we brought
the themes of representation and inference together for the first
time: we showed how to construct a system which drew on freely
available inference tools (such as theorem provers and model-builders)
to construct first-order semantic representations for sentences and
short texts.  At the end of the second week we brought them together
in a deeper way: we showed how to use such tools to implement van der
Sandt's DRT-based presupposition algorithm.

<p>
By and large, the course seems to have been a success. Attendance
peaked at 120, and 90 stayed on till the end. The sessions were a
blend of straight lectures, system demos, and discussing the answers
to assignments.  Students from a wide variety of backgrounds attended
(even computational biology was represented) and feedback was
generally positive.

<p>
We would like to thank the EACL for their financial support (it made a
big difference) and our students for their helpful feedback on the
material presented.

<h2>6. Future Events: ESSLLI02 in Trento, ITALY</h2>

The Fourteenth European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
(ESSLLI) will take place in Trento from the 4th to the 17th of August
2002. It is co-organized by the Istituto Trentino di Cultura and the
University of Trento.

<p>
The program committee (chaired by Claire Gardent) selected 42 courses
and 6 workshops, equally distributed in the different
disciplines of Logic, Language and Computation. In 2002, we have paid
particular attention to interdisciplinary courses, suppressing
the traditional three mono-thematic sections on Logic, Language,
and Computation in order to leave more space for the other
three combined sections on logic & language, logic & computation, and
language & computation. The overall program is varied and
covers most of the standard and advanced topics in these areas. 
The six workshops have been equally distributed in the three sections.
Special attention this year has been given on the application of the
strategic area of semantic web, organizing a special workshop on this
issue. 

<p>
The full program, with the detailed description of the courses and
workshops, is available on the web site www.esslli2002.it.  The
section "Language & Computation" contains the following courses and
workshops:

<p>
<b>Foundational</b>

<ol>
<li>Shallow Text Processing (C. Brew)</li>
<li>Working with Corpora (M. Wolters)</li>

</ol>

<p>
As in previous years, EACL will sponsor one of the courses on the
foundational or introductory tracks, with the intention of attracting
more people to Computational Linguistics. In the recent past, EACL has
sponsored the following courses:

<ul>
<li>1999 Standards for Language Encoding 
         Tomaz Erjavec</li> 
<li>2000 An Introduction to Grammar Engineering using HPSG 
         Ann Copestake and Rob Malouf</li>
<li>2001 An Introduction to Computational Semantics 
         Patrick Blackburn and Johan Bos</li>
</ul>

<p>
In 2002 EACL will sponsor: "Shallow Text Processing" (Chris Brew)

<p>
In return for the EACL sponsorship, members of EACL get a reduced
registration fee at ESSLLI. So don't forget to mention your EACL
affiliation when you register!
    
<h2>7. European Gossip</h2>

<h3>GERMAN FUTURE PRIZE FOR WOLFGANG WAHLSTER OF DFKI</h3>

The 2001 German Future Prize of the Federal President was awarded
to Wolfgang Wahlster, Managing Director of DFKI.

<p>
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Johannes Rau,
presented the German Future Prize to Prof. Wahlster for his project
"Computer Language Processing for Dialog and Translation
Assistants". Wahlster led the project Verbmobil, which was executed by
a consortium of partners from both science and industry, to
internationally recognized success. The project has given rise to a
number of marketable products and startup companies.

<p>
The 500,000 Deutschmark President's prize is awarded each year for
outstanding innovations in technology, engineering, or the natural
sciences. Proven prospects for practical application, unrestricted
marketability, and the creation of new jobs are crucial criteria for
the selection of nominees. In 2001, four research groups and projects
were nominated for the final selection process. The jury made its
decision shortly before the ceremony in which President Johannes Rau
presented the prize.

<p>
Wahlster, Managing Director of the German Research Center for
Artificial Intelligence and professor at Saarland University, is the
first computer scientist to receive this prize.  In a brief speech,
Wahlster said: "I am glad to have received this high honor now, in the
middle of my career, and not at the end of my years of active
research.

<p>
The prize both encourages and obligates me to continue to tackle
important open problems in the area of human-technology interaction,
to create innovations that will lead to a human knowledge society,
and to inspire and educate young students who can contribute to this
fascinating area of computer science. This prize will give a great
boost to the rapid dissemination of the results of our research: I'm
sure that our twenty spin-off products and sixteen startup firms will
now be joined by others, which will lead to the creation of more new
jobs and of further innovations of lasting value."


<h3>NEW WEB INFORMATION CENTER LT WORLD</h3>

The German Competence Center for Language Technology at DFKI has put
the first preliminary version of their virtual information center LT
World on the web.  The service can be viewed at
<a href="http://www.lt-world.org"></a>http://www.lt-world.org.  It contains thousands of references and
information on technologies, researchers, projects, institutions,
organisations, systems and events.  Within the next few months, the
website will be extended and cleaned from remaining errors.
