<h2>Editorial</h2>

An interesting conference season has started for the EACL part of the
world. The ACL Barcelona decisions have been made (papers accepted for
the main session are listed below) and the COLING Geneva decisions are
expected any moment now. In addition, there is LREC in Lisbon, and
various smaller events (listed in the calendar below).  Some events
have already taken place: the EAMT workshop in Malta (report below),
and the IJCNLP meeting at Hainan (also reported on below).
<p>

In addition, we have an article describing the PASCAL Network
challenges, from Ido Dagan. In the series of newsletter items on
national CL/NLP events we have Spain (SEPLN). EACL secretary John
Carroll announces the establishment of the EACL Foundation, and we also
include the newly drawn up EACL policy on sponsorships; information
about both of these is online at the EACL web site
<tt>http://www.eacl.org/</tt>
<p>

As always, contributions for the next issue of the newsletter are
welcomed at <tt>vannoord@let.rug.nl</tt>.

<h2>EACL Foundation</h2>

The EACL Foundation was established on 29 October 2003, with the
official seat in Groningen, The Netherlands. The official title of the
foundation is "Stichting European Chapter of the Association for
Computational Linguistics", or "Stichting EACL" for short. The
motivation for the foundation is to create a "European legal person" in
order to allow EACL to apply for grants to European funding bodies.
<p>
Important points in the foundation statutes are:
<ul>
<li>The foundation board consists of the three primary officers of the
EACL, ex officio, the Chair, Secretary and Treasurer.
<li>The EACL Advisory Board is an advisory committee to the foundation
board.
<li> The foundation board must hold an annual meeting, not later than 6
months after the end of the financial year (which coincides with the
calendar year). Board meetings will be held in conjunction with Chapter
scientific meetings, as far as possible.
<li> Before July 1 every year the foundation board must compile and all
sign a written financial statement covering the previous year,
accompanied by a report on the activities performed.
</ul>
The foundation statutes are online at the EACL web-site
<tt>http://www.eacl.org/</tt>. The EACL Board is very grateful to John Nerbonne
for the work he has done towards creating the foundation.

<h2>PASCAL Network of Excellence Challenges</h2>

The PASCAL FP6 network of excellence (<tt>http://www.pascal-network.org</tt>)
started its activities officially on December 1, 2003. PASCAL (Pattern
Analysis, Statistical Modeling and Computational Learning) involves
more than 250 researchers and PhD students from 58 institutions in
Europe, Israel and Australia. Its primary objective consists in
improving the interactions between experts in statistics,
computational learning theory, optimization and a number of other
areas to which such theoretical disciplines can be applied, including
NLP (program manager Nicola Cancedda) and Textual Information Access
(TIA) (program manager Dunja Mladenic).
<p>

In this context, a workshop titled "Learning Methods for Text
Understanding and Mining" was held on January 26-29, 2004 at the Xerox
Research Centre Europe in Grenoble, France. About 70 participants
attended tutorials, scientific presentations and the presentation of
"challenge" benchmark proposals (see <tt>http://www.pascal-network.org/
Workshops/LMTUM04/</tt>, including online links to all papers under the
Programme section).
<p>

PASCAL Challenges are common benchmarks to monitor progress in NLP and
TIA, organized by PASCAL members. Detailed announcements of these
challenges will come out in the next couple of months and will be
available on the PASCAL web site. Three out of the eight Pascal
Challenge proposals that were selected for 2004 are in the NLP
area. The results of the first two challenges below will be gathered
at the PASCAL Challenge workshop in Southampton in the beginning of
November 2004 while the last challenge will be launched at that
moment. For further information, please contact directly the authors
or look at the challenge page of the PASCAL web-site.
<p>


<h3>Assessing ML methodologies to extract implicit relations from documents<br>
Contact author : fabio@dcs.shf.ac.uk<br>
Start: June 2004, End: October 2004</h3>

The challenge is to assess the current situation of Machine Learning
algorithms for Information Extraction from documents, identifying
future challenges and foster additional research in the field.  Aims
are to (1) define a methodology for fair comparison of ML algorithms
for IE; (2) define a publicly available resource for evaluation that
will exist and be used beyond the lifetime of the challenge; (3)
perform actual tests of different algorithms in controlled situations
so to understand what works and what does not.
<p>

<h3>Recognizing Textual entailment <br>
Contact author : dagan@cs.biu.ac.il<br>
Start: June 2004, End: October 2004</h3>

The goal of this challenge is to create a new benchmark task dedicated
to textual entailment - the task of recognizing whether the meaning of
one text fragment is entailed by another text or not. This task
generalizes prominent semantic inferences which are common within many
practical NLP applications, such as Question Answering, Information
Extraction, summarization and multi-document summarization,
translation evaluation, paraphrasing, and certain types of queries in
Information Retrieval. The goal of the challenge is to introduce a
generic practical semantic inference task, which will promote the
creation of generic semantic models, learning algorithms, knowledge
bases and engines that can be utilized for multiple applications.
<p>

<h3>Ontology evaluation and population <br>
Contact author : eric.gaussier@xrce.xerox.com<br>
Start : November 2004, End : March 2005
</h3>

Ontologies are formal, explicit specifications of shared
conceptualizations, representing concepts and their relations that are
relevant to a given domain of discourse.  Currently, ontologies are
mostly developed as well as used through a manual process, which is
very ineffective and may cause major barriers to their large-scale use
in such areas as Knowledge Discovery and Semantic Web. As human
language is a primary mode of knowledge transfer, linguistic analysis
of relevant documents for this purpose seems a viable option. More
precisely, automation of ontology construction (ontology learning) and
use (ontology population through knowledge markup) can be implemented
by a combined use of linguistic analysis and machine learning
approaches for text mining.  This challenge aims at (a) evaluating in
a quantitative manner how useful or accurate the extracted ontology
classes, attributes and instances are, and (b) developing a
well-grounded learning framework for the task.  The first task of this
challenge (November 2004-March 2005) will deal with Taxonomy Induction
and Population while the second task (June 2005-November 2005) will
deal with extraction of non taxonomic relations.

<h2>National CL/NLP Conferences: SEPLN Spain</h2>


The Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing (SEPLN) is a not
for-profit association, composed of full-member partners and
Institutions, which was created in 1984 aiming to promote and
disseminate all type of activities related to teaching, research and
development in the field of Natural Language Processing, both at the
national and international levels. Currently, the Society has around
350 members.
<p>

SEPLN is focused on establishing information and scientific materials
exchange channels, organising seminars, symposiums and conferences,
promoting publications and collaborating with other related
Institutions. Members of the society are actively involved in ACL, and
have supported the organization of both the ACL/EACL 97 Conference in
Madrid, and this year ACL Conference in Barcelona.
<p>

Some of the most relevant activities conducted by SEPLN include the
celebration of an annual Conference as a meeting point for the range
of research groups that are operational in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) field mainly in Spain and Ibero-American countries;
the edition of a publication which, counting with an editorial board,
assures stable criteria in terms of quality and periodicity; an
Internet server offering NLP related information and an e-mail service
which, in addition to offering NLP news, operates as a discussion
forum for members.
<p>

The SEPLN publishes two issues per year of the journal "Procesamiento
del Lenguaje Natural".  One including papers of the Conference and the
other including presentations of current projects, papers, reports of
bibliography and summaries of doctoral thesis. (31 issues have been
already produced,
cf. <tt>http://www.sepln.org/revistaSEPLN/pubrevista.htm</tt>).  An
annual award for young researchers was established in 2002, the
selected works are published in a special monographic collection,
currently three titles are available.
<p>

This year the XX Conference of the Spanish Society for Natural
Language Processing (SEPLN'04) is held in Barcelona, July 21. Papers
can be submitted in all the official languages of Spain as well as
English. You can obtain further information about SEPLN at
<tt>http://www.sepln.org</tt>.

<h2>Conference Report: IJCNLP Hainan</h2>

In March, the Asian counterpart of the EACL organised its first
international conference on the tropical Chinese island Hainan. The
conference was organised at a holiday resort situated at the beach in
a beautiful part of the island close to Sanya City. This exotic
location is perhaps an additional reason for the success of the
conference: with 226 registered conference attendees the conference
did better than expected. The main conference program attracted 211
submissions, which resulted eventually in 95 contributions (about a
third in the form of posters). It was a truly international conference
with participants from 19 different countries. Most participants were
from Asian countries (80%), but there were participants from Europe
and USA as well (each about 10%).
<p>

The conference was very well organised by the Chinese Information
Processing Society of China, with important help from the Chinese
University of Hong Kong. It's hard to judge the quality of the
conference, but I definitely heard a number of very interesting papers
(and yes, there were also a few less interesting papers, which
provided good excuse to take a dive in the South Chinese Sea; my
ignorance with respect to Asian languages was mostly to blame for
those though).  Personally, I liked the accompanying workshop entitled
'Beyond Shallow Analyses', which was the reason for my presence in
Hainan. It was a small workshop, but very interesting. The invited
talk by Mark Johnson during the main conference fitted nicely with the
topic of the workshop.  Another interesting event was a forum on the
preparation of various (very ambitious!) Chinese NLP projects which
are being organised in the context of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.
<p>

At the end of the conference there were two surprises: the best paper
award was *not* awarded, because the committee could not choose between
the three nominated candidates! The second surprise was the
announcement that the next IJCNLP conference will most probably be
held at the Korean island Jeju (in october 2005), and be organised by
Jong Hyeok Lee of the Pohang University of Science and Technology.

<h2>Workshop Report: EAMT-04 Malta</h2>

The fourth workshop of the European Association for Machine
Translation was held in Malta on 26th and 27th April 2004. About 55
people attended the workshop, and during the densely packed two days,
some eighteen papers were presented at the Foundation for
International Studies, the original seat of the University of Malta
situated in the centre of Valletta.
<p>

About half the papers were oriented towards the special workshop
themes: MT-related issues concerning semitic languages, and other
languages of EU accession states. Although the subject matter was
rather varied, a persistent difficulty with these languages that came
across in the talks is lack of appropriate language resources for
building MT systems. Some papers addressed these issues directly, and
it is interesting to see different approaches being proposed (e.g. the
use of machine-learning techniques to infer transfer rules from
limited data, the investigation of very closely related accession
languages such as Czech and Slovak in order to capitalise on very
simple automated techniques).
<p>

The invited speaker was Joris Goetschalckx, who, apart from having a
last name that is challenging to pronounce, is head of the European
Commission Translation Field Office in Malta. He gave some insight
into the peculiar situation that obtains in Malta where the decision
to make Maltese an official EU language took everyone by surprise,
especially the many bilingual speakers who discovered that their
knowledge was not up to EU standards. Consequently, where previously
there was no problem, there are now two: an official problem of
translating large volumes of EU†legislation into Maltese, and an
official lack of qualified translators. Both are being addressed, and
both are, in different ways, likely to have a positive impact upon MT
research carried out locally.
<p>

Those wishing to access further details of the workshop can obtain a
copy of the proceedings by contacting Mike Rosner, the local organiser
(<tt>mike.rosner@um.edu.mt</tt>) or visiting the EAMT website (<tt>www.eamt.org</tt>).

<h2>EACL Sponsorship Policy</h2>

<h4>Scale</h4>

<p>
Each year, the EACL may make available a limited number of
sponsorships each worth a relatively small amount of money.
Sponsorships are awarded only if the EACL budget allows it.  </p> 

<p>
As an indication, in 2003, the EACL awarded three sponsorships, of
approximately 750 Euros each.  </p> 

<h4>Focus</h4> 

<p> In awarding sponsorships, EACL focuses on education in
computational linguistics in the geographical area of the
EACL. Priority is given to students from Eastern Europe and more
generally, to students from countries with hard currency problems
(within the geographical area covered by EACL).  </p> 

<p>
In the past, EACL has sponsored introductory courses at European
summer-schools (in the form of a contribution towards the presenters'
expenses), participation at summer-schools (funding tuition fees and
subsistence expenses for students who would otherwise not have been
able to come) and participation at student workshops at EACL
conferences (contribution towards student-presenters' expenses).
</p>  

<h4>Visibility</h4>

<p>
In return for sponsorship, EACL expects some visibility (for instance,
the sponsorship is announced in a workshop programme and website
etc.). A request for sponsorship must include a description of the
visibility for EACL generated by the sponsorship.  </p>


<h4> Procedure</h4>

<p>
A request for sponsorship should identify a concrete purpose. Indeed,
EACL will not sponsor a school or workshop in general, but it will
sponsor a particular course, tutorial, etc., or it will sponsor
participation for a particular group of students etc.
</p>

<p>A request for sponsorship should contain the following information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A short description of the event involved (summer school,
  conference, student workshp etc.) and of its relevance to
  computational linguistics 
<li> A proposal for ensuring EACL
  visibility in return for sponsorship
<li> A specification of the intended use of sponsorship -- this should
  state the precise purpose of the sponsorhip (e.g., fee waiving for
  students/participants, travel grants, accommodation cost) and a
  clear description of how funding will be used.
<li> Motivation and justification for request.  
</ul>

<p>
When the sponsorship is requested in view of funding the participation
of individuals (students, scholars, lecturers etc.) to the event, the
selection of the sponsorship recipients will be done jointly by the
EACL and the requesting party as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li> The requesting party will make a selection and submit it for
  approval to the EACL board.
<li> The selection will be provided to the EACL together with any
  information judged relevant. For instance, in the case of a request
  for supporting student participation, the following information
  about the candidates should be included:
<ul>
<li> Name, email address, affiliation and status (PhD year etc.) of
  the candidate
  <li>Source and amount of yearly income
<li>Letter of motivation
  <li>Whether the candidate makes a presentation at the event
<li>Proof of student status
  <li>Letter of recommendation (e.g., from supervisor)
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Requests for sponsorships should be directed by email to one of the
EACL board members, who passes on the request to the board.  </p> 

<p>
The EACL board decides within a month on a sponsorship request.
Sponsorships are normally requested by and awarded to conferences,
workshops, summer schools etc. Sponsorship requests from individuals
will not be considered.
