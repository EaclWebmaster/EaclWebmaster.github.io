<P><STRONG>23rd conference on Computational Linguistics in The Netherlands</STRONG> (CLIN)
<BR> January 18, 2013
<BR> Entschede, The Netherlands
</P>

<p>On Friday 18 January 2013, the 23rd meeting of Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands (CLIN 2013) took place in Enschede, The Netherlands. The location of the meeting was slightly unusual: Poppodium Atak in the Music Quarter of Enschede, with sessions taking place in (among other places) the concert halls, the café and the theatre hall. Many participants commented that they appreciated the special venue. </p>

<p>The CLIN conference is mainly aimed at The Netherlands and Flanders (the Dutch language region of Belgium), but among the 125+ participants of CLIN 2013 many other countries were represented, ranging from nearby Germany to far away China, Russia and USA. </p>

<P><IMG SRC="images/clin_hall.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=312 BORDER=0><BR><FONT SIZE=2>Audience in the big concert hall</FONT></P>

<p>More than 90 abstracts were submitted for CLIN 2013, leading to an extensive programme featuring 59 oral presentations (presented in 5 parallel sessions) and 19 poster presentations (including 4 software demonstrations) on a wide variety of topics in computational linguistics.</p>

<p>There was also a plenary talk from CLARIN-NL, a large project in the Netherlands that aims to make a significant contribution to the European CLARIN infrastructure;  a research infrastructure for humanities researchers that work with language data and tools. </p>

<p>A new track introduced at CLIN 2013 was the Industry Track, which had eight talks on a large variety of language technology research in industry. It may have been a factor in attracting industry attention to CLIN 2013: among the participants were representatives from 12 different companies. </p>

<p>The full programme of the event can be found on the <a href="http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/clin2013/">CLIN 2013 website</a></p>

<p>All in all, we look back on a very successful and inspiring conference.  All authors of accepted abstracts were invited to submit a full version of their paper to volume 3 of the <a href="http://www.clinjournal.org">CLIN journal</a>. A selection of the 20 submitted papers will be published by the end of 2013.</p>

<H2><A NAME="nodalida"></A>Report on NODALIDA 2013</H2>
<P><STRONG>The 19th Nordic Conference of Comoputational Linguistics<BR>
</STRONG><BR>
May 22-24, 2013<BR>
University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway</P>

<p>NODALIDA 2013 (The 19th Nordic Conference of Computational Linguistics) was held 22 - 24 May 2011 in Oslo, Norway, on the campus of the University of Oslo. </p>

<p>The conference has been held every two years in various northern European universities since 1977, and this was the first time the conference was arranged in Oslo. NODALIDA is arranged by NEALT - Northern European Association for Language Technology. The conference attracts researchers and language technologists from universities in many countries in Northern Europe: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and northwest Russia. The main theme is language technology in many different forms such as speech recognition and speech synthesis, tagging and parsing, language modelling, machine learning for natural language, machine translation and more. </p>

<p>Although there are international language technology conferences, NODALIDA is especially important for the participating countries because it brings together participants from small northern European language communities with common challenges compared to worldwide speaking communities like English or Spanish. At the same time, NODALIDA has a good reputation around the world, and also attracts researchers from other places than northern Europe.</p>

<H3>Main conference</H3>

<p>NODALIDA 2013 registered 141 participants including 3 invited speakers. The main conference was held Thursday and Friday, May 23 and 24. See the conference homepage and programme at the <a href="www.hf.uio.no/nodalida">conference website</a>. Thursday evening a Special Session on HPC for NLP was arranged. </p>

<p>The conference received 60 submissions from all over Europe, including one each from Mexico and the US. 38 were presented at the conference: 12 as oral presentations, 20 as posters and demonstrations/lightening talks, and 6 as student oral presentations. All submissions were reviewed by at least three experts in the field (two for demonstration papers), and the final selection was made by the Programme Committee.</p>

<H3>Invited speakers</H3>

<p>The main conference had three invited plenary presentations by key figures in speech and language technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ron Kaplan (Nuance Communications and Stanford University, USA):<i>The Conversation User Interface</i></li>
  <li>Caroline Sporleder (University of Trier, Germany):<i>Detecting and Processing Figurative Language in Discourse</i></li>
  <li>Anders Søgaard (University of Copenhagen, Denmark):<i>6,909 Reasons to Mess Up Your Data Workshops</i></li>
</ul>

<p>84 participants were registered for 4 workshops on the Wednesday preceding the main conference: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Second Workshop on NLP for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (Afternoon workshop) </li>
  <li>Workshop on Computational Historical Linguistics (Whole day workshop)</li>
  <li>Workshop on Lexical Semantic Resources for NLP (Afternoon workshop)</li>
  <li>Workshop on Nordic Language Research Infrastructure (Afternoon workshop)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each workshop had its own set of organizers and programme committee. The programmes and other information on the workshops can be found on the <a href="http://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/news-and-events/events/conferences/2013/nodalida/workshops/">NODALIDA workshops page</a>. </p>

<H3>Social programme</H3>

<p>The conference dinner was arranged at Restaurant Argent at the spectacular Oslo Opera House on Wednesday, May 22. After aperitifs in the Opera foyer, the participants were guided to Scene 2 and a small opera concert before dinner. Thursday, May 23, the participants were invited to a guided tour and a reception with a standing buffet at the beautiful Oslo City Hall.</p>

<H3>Sponsors</H3>

<p>The conference was sponsored by the following companies and projects: The Research Council of Norway (main sponsor), Lingit, Max Manus, INESS, WeSearch, Letterstedtska föreningen and the <a href="http://omilia.uio.no/nealt/?task=affiliations">NEALT-sponsors</a>.

<H2><A NAME="sepln"></A>Report on SEPLN 2013</H2>
<P><STRONG>The 29th edition of the Annual Conference of the Spanish
Society for Natural Language Processing</STRONG><BR>
September 18-20, 2013<BR>
Universitat Complutense de Madrid, Spain</P>

<p>The 29th edition of the Annual Conference of the Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing (SEPLN) took place in the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain), on September 18, 19 and 20, 2013. It was co-located with the Spanish multi-Conference on Informatics CEDI 2013. The President of the Scientific Committee was Alberto Díaz and the President of the Organizing Committee was Luis Hernández.</p>

<p>The main goal of this annual conference is to be a forum for the presentation of the latest research and development in Natural Language Processing by the scientific community and the industry. It also aims to showcase actual applications and to introduce new R&D projects in the field. As in previous editions, the conference intends to identify future trends for basic research and applications as foreseen by professionals, in order to contrast them with actual market needs. Finally, the conference expects to be an enabling framework to introduce new people with an interest in this area of knowledge.</p>

<p>SEPLN 2013 received 53 submissions, out of which 45 were submitted as long papers and 8 as short papers (3 demonstrations and 5 ongoing R&amp;D projects). The conference accepted 30 papers (acceptance rate of 49%), which were presented as either oral presentations (22 papers) or posters (8 papers). The papers were selected by a Program Committee of 35 reviewers from Europe, Mexico and Cuba. The reviewing process was a two-round review and the submitted papers were subjected to a blind review by at least three members of the Scientific Committee. A selection of the presented papers was published in the issue 51 of the journal Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural (ISSN: 1135-5948, ISSN: 1989-7553), which is publicly available at the <a href="http://www.sepln.org/">SEPLN site</a>.</p>

<p>There were two keynote speakers at the conference:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jörg Tiedemann (Uppsala University, Sweden) presented the talk <i>Linguistic Solidarity in Machine Translation - Statistical MT for Under-Resourced Languages and Domains</i>.</li>
  <li>Horacio Saggion (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain) presented the talk <i>Text Simplification in Spanish: What for?</i></li>
</ul>

<p>The main conference was followed by two co-located workshops:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tweet Normalization Workshop at SEPLN 2013</li>
    <li>2nd Workshop on Sentiment Analysis at SEPLN (TASS 2013)</li>
  </ul>


<p>SEPLN 2013 had 62 participants.</p>
