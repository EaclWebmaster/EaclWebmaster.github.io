<a name="lct"><h2>European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (LCT)</h2></a>

<p>A consortium of 10 European Universities (Saarland, Bolzano, Prague, Malta, Copenhagen Business School, Roskilde, Utrecht, Amsterdam, Nancy 1 and Nancy 2) offer an integrated European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (LCT).</p>

<p>A common curriculum has been agreed which follows the Bologna model for higher education in Europe and comprises 120 ECTS credits, 30 of which make up the Masters dissertation, and 90 of which are coursework credits made up of compulsory modules in Computer Science (28 ECTS) and Language Technology (28 ECTS), and advanced modules (34 ECTS) in these and related areas. The exact implementation of modules is left up to the individual Universities, allowing for limited variation exploiting the special strengths of each institution.</p>

<p>Coursework is distributed over three semesters, while the dissertation is completed in the fourth semester.</p>

<p>Students get the chance to attend the two-year program at two universities chosen from the consortium, spending about half the time at each. Those completing the course will obtain a legally valid Masters degree from each of the two institutions attended.</p>
