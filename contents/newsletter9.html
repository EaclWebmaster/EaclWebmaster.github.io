<h2>EDITORIAL</h2>
<p>
Welcome to the EACL newsletter for year 2007.  In the time that has
passed since the last issue, several exciting events related to our
community have taken place in Europe.  We are reporting on this below.
But first of all, let us start with some announcements of interest.
</p>
<p>
The 12th conference of the EACL will take place in year 2009 in
Athens, Greece.  The structure and dates of the programme are already
available: tutorials and workshops will take place on March 30 and 31,
followed by the main conference on April 1, 2, and 3.  Please make
sure you put these dates on your diaries.  More information on this
event are found below in the note by Alex Lascarides, EACL Chair.
</p>
<p>
Some new people have joined the advisory board and the student board
of EACL.  Anette Frank, EACL Secretary, has written a welcome section
introducing the new members.  As every year, the student board has
carefully edited a dense calendar of events of interest that will soon
take place, not limited to Europe.  The document is now available in
the EACL home page, and we provide here a link.  The calendar will be
continuously updated in the months to come.
</p>
<p>
To start with our list of events, this year we have had a very
exciting edition of the ACL 2007 conference, which was jointly hosted
by ACL and EACL.  The conference was held in Prague and was a massive
success, with an unprecedented number of participants.  This
newsletter contains a very detailed report about the conference, its
program, and the satellite events, written by Eva Hajicova, chair of
the local organising committee, and by the sponsorship chair Jan Hajic
and the publicity chair Pavel Stranak.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, we have a report on ESSLLI 2007, which took place in
Dublin, Ireland, written by Tomaz Erjavec, the chair of the program
committee.  We also have a report on EUROLAN 2007, which took place in
Iasi, Romania, written by Dan Cristea, Corina Forascu, Rada Mihalcea
and Dan Tufis, on behalf of the program and organisation committees.
</p>
<p>
This time, unfortunately, we have to close with what has come to be
very sad news for all of us.  Professor Karen Sparck Jones passed away
on 4 April 2007.  We are reporting below an obituary, written by John
I. Tait, reprinted from the Computational Linguistics journal with the
kind permission of the editor.

<h2>View From The Chair</h2>
<p>
Since the last newsletter, EACL's main activity has been to choose a
site to host EACL 2009.  This will take place in Athens, from March
30th to April 3rd.  Vangelis Karkaletsis (Demokritos, Athens
University of Economics and Business) is the chair of the local
organising committee.  The local team has lots of experience in
hosting events of a similar size, and I am sure that they will do a
fantastic job in welcoming us to Athens in 2009.  I am very grateful
to them for taking on this responsibility.
</p>

<p>
We have also chosen our programme committee chairs for EACL 2009: I'm
pleased to say that both Claire Gardent (Nancy) and Joakim Nivre
(Vaxjo) have agreed to take on this role.  You will be receiving a
call for papers towards the end of the Summer 2008.  I would urge
everyone to submit a paper, and to attend the conference!
</p>

<p>
There have been a number of changes among EACL's board members.  I
would especially like to thank Gertjan van Noord for his fantastic
work as Chair of EACL 2005--2006.  I know now from experience how much
work is involved in being a member of the ACL executive committee!  I
would also like to thank Galia Angelova, Ido Dagan and Felisa Verdejo
for all their suggestions and proposals, as advisory members of the
EACL board over the last few years.  Their tenure on the board also
ceased at the beginning of the year.  Luckily, we haven't lost Gertjan
and Felisa completely, as they have become members of the nominating
committee, replacing Donia Scott and Philippe Blanche.  Donia and
Philippe have done so much for EACL over the last 10 years, and we
will miss them.  I would also like to thank Jonathan Read and Violeta
Seretan, for running the student sessions in the last EACL.  They have
now stepped down as members of the student board, and I wish them well
in their future careers.
</p>

<p>
I would also like to welcome our new members of the board: Giorgio
Satta is the Chair Elect for EACL (2007--2008), and Eric Gaussier,
Kiril Simov and Josef van Genabith have joined the board as advisory
members.  Our new members of the EACL student board are Vera Demberg
(Edinburgh) and Yanjun Ma (Dublin).  They will be helping to organise
the student session for EACL 2009.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the call for bids to host ACL 2010 in Europe was released at
ACL in Prague.  I very much hope you will consider putting in a bid to
host it.  Please contact Steven Bird if you have any questions about
it.

<h2>Report on ACL 2007</h2>
<p>
The 45th ACL Annual Meeting has been held in Prague on June 23-30,
2007 organized by the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics at
Charles University in Prague. It was the largest ACL meeting ever held
by the ACL during the time of its existence. There were more than 1000
participants from abroad, coming from 48 countries, and about 70
researchers and students from the Czech Republic, mostly from Charles
University in Prague. The meeting was held under the auspices of the
former Rector of Charles University prof. ing. Ivan Wilhelm, the
present-day Rector of the University prof. RNDr. Vaclav Hampl (who
welcomed the participants on behalf of the University at the opening
session) and the Mayor of the City of Prague MUDr. Pavel Bem. The
General Chair of the Conference was John Carroll; the programme chairs
were Annie Zeanen and Antal van den Bosch, the tutorial chair Joakim
Nivre and the workshop chair Simone Teufel. The Local Organizing
Committee was headed by Eva Hajicova with Jan Hajic as Local
Coordinator and Anna Kotesovcova as Local Arrangements Chair.
</p>
<p>
The three-day main conference consisted of four parallel sessions and
one student session. There were 588 submissions for the main
conference out of which 131 have been accepted (acceptance rate
22,30%). The invited speakers were Tom Mitchell (on the relations
between language, meaning, and brain), and Barney Pell (from Powerset)
on intelligent text retrieval.
</p>
<p>
15 workshops were organized before and after the conference and there
were also two adjoined conferences, the International Workshop on
Parsing Technologies (IWPT) and the joint conference on Empirical
Methods in Natural Language Processing and on Computational Natural
Language Learning (EMNLP-CoNLL). The EMNLP-CoNLL joint conference this
year was also exceptionally large, there were more than 340
participants and 398 submissions from which 66 were accepted as papers
and 43 as posters, making the acceptance rate 27%. This conference
also included some short reports on the results of a point task
concerning dependency based analysis applied to annotated corpora of
several languages.
</p>
<p>
There were five tutorials before the main conference with a range of
topics: special statistical methods for NLP, data mining from
Internet, dialogue systems, methods of logical inferencing from texts
and methods of evaluation and advancing the quality of corpus
annotation.
</p>
<p>
The Best Paper Award went to Yuk Wah Wong a Raymond J. Money who
delivered the paper "Learning Synchronous Grammars for Semantic
Parsing with Lambda Calculus".
</p>
<p>
The recipient of the 2007 Life Achievement Award was a very
influential theoretical and computational linguist, Lauri Karttunen
>from Stanford University, USA.
</p>
<p>
Among the sponsors of the 2007 ACL meeting there were Google,
Microsoft, IBM, Xerox, TextKernel, BBN, Morphologic, NewsTin,
Powerset, the Czech Association for Information Science and some
others.
</p>
<p>
This was the third time when Prague hosted an international meeting on
computational linguistics: after a rather small but for that time
rather influential Colloquium on Algebraic Linguistics in 1964 there
was a COLING Conference in Prague in 1982, with almost 400
participants, at the occasion of which the foundation of the European
Chapter of ACL was announced by Donald Walker, the then ACL Secretary,
accompanied by the establishment of the ACL International Fund which
made it possible for considerably economically handicapped researchers
>from Central and Eastern European countries to be ACL members,
receiving the journal and being supported in their participation at
the ACL meetings. This was one of the greatest support we have got and
by organizing the 2007 ACL meeting we also wanted to express our
gratefulness.

<h2>Report on ESSLLI 2007</h2>
<p>
The 19th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
took place at Trinity College, Dublin, 6-17 August, 2007. The summer
school offered 40 courses, as usual divided into three levels
(foundational, introductory and advanced) and three tracks (language
and logic, logic and computation, and language and computation).  The
courses were accompanied by 6 workshops and 4 evening lectures. 
</p>
<p>
The Language and Computation track gave courses on, for example,
ontologies and semantics (also the topics of two evening lectures),
machine learning, multimedia, machine translation, evaluation,
parsing, etc.
</p>
<p>
This years summer was attended by over 300 students and lecturers, and
the teaching and learning was complemented by cricket and other joys
of Dublin. A number of students were sponsored by EACL.
</p>

<h2>Report on EUROLAN 2007</h2>

<p>
EUROLAN 2007 Summer School: Semantics, Opinions and Sentiments in Texts 
http://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/
</p>
<p>
In the middle of this hot summer, the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University
of Iasi, Romania hosted the 8th edition of the EUROLAN Summer
Schools. Continuing a tradition already established since 1993, the
theme selected for the school was on one of the forefront research
subjects in Computational Linguistics. Sentiment and opinion analysis
were discussed in conjunction with semantic analysis in a tentative to
evidence the connection between them in text and speech.
</p>
<p>
During the two intensive weeks of the summer school, the program
included tutorials, practical sessions, as well as two satellite
events organized as evening activities. The topics addressed by the
school -- which included the discovery of subjectivity indicators,
subjectivity and sentiment analysis in blogs, frontiers between
subjectivity and objectivity, discourse and dialogue structure and
modeling, annotation for deep semantics, emotions, intentions and
meanings from text and speech, applications of opinion and sentiment
analysis, multilingual and multicultural aspects of opinions and
sentiments, attribution of opinion and sentiment, the future of
Semantic Web -- have been successfully covered by our guest
lecturers: Mathieu d'Aquin, Dan Cristea, Nancy Ide, Rada Mihalcea,
Paola Monachesi, Enrico Motta, Nicolas Nicolov, Livia Polanyi, Carlo
Strapparava, Horia-Nicolai Teodorescu, Dan Tufis, Janyce Wiebe, Yorick
Wilks, and Michael Zock.
</p>
<p>
The two satellite events (a Doctoral Consortium dedicated to young
researchers and a workshop on Applications of Semantics, Opinions and
Sentiments in e-Learning) raised the interest of a significant part of
the attendees of EUROLAN 2007.
</p>
<p>
As in previous editions the school attracted about 100 participants
coming from 15 countries. About 30 participants have been supported by
Microsoft Research through their MR Inspire program. This generous
support was complemented by the traditional sponsor of EUROLAN -- the
Romanian Ministry of Education and Research -- and local sponsors,
mainly Romanian IT enterprises.
</p>
<p>
The traditional social events (a trip, this year to discover the
famous monasteries of Bucovina, and a city tour) were delightfully
diversified with a much appreciated contest, "Taste it!... and rank
your opinions," in which the participants could enjoy national
meals, wine, music, dances, and virtual cultural trip.
</p>

<h2>Obituary for Karen Sparck Jones</h2>
<p>
Karen Sparck Jones died peacefully on 4 April 2007 after a number of
months battling cancer. Karen was President of the Association for
Computational Linguistics in 1994 during a difficult period, and saw
through a transitional phase in which a solid basis for the long-term
health of the association was established.
</p>
<p>
Karen was an exceptional individual who made very substantial
contributions in two separate fields, computational linguistics (CL)
and information retrieval (IR), as well as in computing and artificial
intelligence more broadly. In IR, her greatest contribution was
probably her invention (1972) of the concept of inverse document
frequency (IDF), in which the importance of terms is weighted
according to the proportion of documents in the corpus in which they
occur; the intuition being that terms which occur in many documents
are poor index terms. This is the partial basis of all weighting
schemes adopted by widely used Internet search engines, and will
undoubtedly be a lasting contribution to the field.
</p>
<p>
Her primary inspiration and interest was always language, especially
language in practical use. Her long involvement with IR arose (as
someone who subsisted for a inordinately long time on soft money) by
the need to find a new line of research in the aftermath of the ALPAC
Report and the subsequent difficulties in getting machine translation
work funded. However, she was always well qualified to work in IR, a
topic addressed in her very early publications (Masterman, Needham,
and Sparck Jones 1958), although in a rather different context to
her later work.
</p>
<p>
Given this focus on language it is therefore perhaps odd that her main
contributions to CL or natural language processing are harder to pin
down. They include contributions to summarization, natural language
interfaces to structured databases, dialogue, semantics, and more. In
the long term perhaps her greatest contribution will come to be seen
to be her Ph.D. thesis (1964), which was far ahead of its time. It
brought together statistical or machine learning approaches with the
use of an existing resource (Roget's Thesaurus -- punched onto
cards!) and still can be read with profit today (see Wilks and Tait
2005). It can be viewed as the forerunner of a whole range of more
recent attempts to derive semantic information on an empirical basis.
</p>
<p>
It is perhaps as an empiricist that Karen will be best remembered. Her
long associations with the US TREC initiatives and the more recent DUC
summary evaluations are well known, as is her earlier association with
DARPA TIDES, but her desire to work on well-founded experimental bases
runs through from her earliest days, initially through involvement
with Cyril Cleverdon and the Cranfield project, and then later in the
work reported, for example, in Sparck Jones and van Rijsbergen (1976)
and Sparck Jones and Galliers (1996). Perhaps this derived from her
being a long associate of Wittgenstein's student Margaret Masterman
(a connection Karen acknowledged in her acceptance speech for the ACL
Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005) and consequently from the focus of
Wittgenstein's philosophy on language use.
</p>
<p>
Karen was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England in 1935 of English
and Norwegian parents and was very much a child of Second World War
Britain. She initially read History at Cambridge, but graduated in
Philosophy (Moral Sciences). Following a brief spell as a
schoolteacher she joined the Cambridge Language Research Unit in 1957
under Masterman and so began a very lengthy period on soft money. The
University of Cambridge finally recognized her standing by awarding
her a Readership in 1994 and a personal chair in 1999.
</p>
<p>
Karen received very many awards during her career. These include
Fellowships of the American and European Artificial Intelligence
societies, Fellowship of the British Academy, the ACL Lifetime
Achievement Award, the Lovelace Medal of the British Computer Society,
the ACM SIGIR Salton Award, the American Society for Information
Science and Technology's Award of Merit, and the ACM-AAAI Allen
Newell Award.  Finally she was awarded the ACM Women's Group Athena
Award, which sadly she did not live to receive formally, although she
bravely recorded an acceptance lecture a few weeks prior to her death.
</p>
<p>
Although Karen felt she was never overtly discriminated against as a
woman, it must have taken considerable courage and tenacity to develop
a leading academic career at a time when society's expectations of
women went little beyond their roles as wives and mothers. She
acknowledged the support of her parents and then her late husband (and
long-time academic collaborator) Roger Needham in her obtaining a good
education and developing a career. She noted that in professional
circles she was very frequently the only woman, and made very active
efforts, especially in recent years, to interest young women and girls
in careers in computing, believing that "computing was too important to
be left to men." Karen remained as active as ever after her formal and
undesired retirement (see the Guardian Letters Page, 5 October 2002).
</p>
<p>
These academic achievements should not be allowed to eclipse Karen's
wellroundedness as person. She and her late husband Roger were keen
sailors, owning, and maintaining themselves for many years, an 1872
Itchen Ferry Cutter. They also built their first house with their own
hands. Karen could sketch well, made works of art from everyday
objects, and had an enormous knowledge of natural history and church
architecture. She was candid and passionate and could be enormously
generous in her support. She will be greatly missed.
