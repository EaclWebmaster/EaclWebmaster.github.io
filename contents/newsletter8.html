<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p> Welcome to the first EACL newsletter of 2006.  A lot has happened
since the last newsletter.  We had our 11th conference in Trento: the
programme chairs and local organisation chairs have written reports on
it for this newsletter.  They ensured the success of the conference,
and the EACL board are very grateful for their efforts.  By the same
token, the student board requested feedback on the student programme
of EACL 2006.  That feedback is now summarised on the EACL website
(<tt>www.eacl.org</tt>).  Please go and check it out.  Once again,
thanks are due to the student board for organising a very stimulating
student session at EACL 2006.  </p>

<p>
The call for bids to host EACL 2009 has also now been issued.  The
call is included in this newsletter.  Please consider hosting EACL
2009.  If you have any questions about what's involved, then please
email me (<tt>alex@inf.ed.ac.uk</tt>; subject line EACL 2009).
</p>

<p>
In addition, we have a report from Ido Dagan on the last PASCAL
meeting, and from Claire Gardent on TALN.  In spite of the increase in
the number of conferences and workshops in computational linguistics,
many people are currently troubled by the low acceptance rates for
ACL/NAACL/EACL conferences.  Diana McCarthy and Shuly Wintner, the
programme chairs for EACL 2006, have written an article about this
issue, and I hope it will provoke thought and discussion.  
</p>

<p> On that note, in the run-up to EACL 2009, the EACL board wants to
think hard about how we should react to this trend towards extremely
low acceptance rates, and in particular what can be done to encourage
more submissions of thought-provoking and perhaps controversial
research.  We are open to suggestions, which can be considered by the
future programme chair for EACL 2009.  If you have opinions about
this, please forward them to me (<tt>alex@inf.ed.ac.uk</tt>; subject
line EACL PROGRAMME).

<p>
Priscilla's report gives details about EACL membership, and it
indicates how current European activity in computational linguistics
is vibrant and thriving.  In view of this, it becomes vital that EACL
as an organisation maintains some corporate memory: Anette Frank has
written a report on the EACL web archive which is one attempt to
address this problem.  She has also reported on EACL's recent student
sponsorships.  Finally, as always, Sebastian Pado has supplied us with
a Calendar of future events.  Sebastian steps down from the EACL
student board in June.  I would like to thank him for all his efforts
over the past few years, especially on maintaining the EACL website.
He has been fantastic.  He will be replaced by Nuria Bertomeu from 1st
July.  We'll tell you more about her in the next newsletter!

<h2>View From The Chair</h2>
<p>
In April, the 11th conference of the European Chapter of the ACL took
place in Trento. As well over 300 participants have witnessed, Trento
is a beautiful historical city on the border of north and south,
exhibiting not only many Italian aspects, but also some Germanic ones,
as exemplified during the banquet for instance!  In the week of the
conference, even the weather exhibited southern and northern aspects,
ranging from a nice spring day on the Sunday when everybody arrived,
to some rain and some snow (if you looked up at the mountains
surrounding Trento in all directions), and again lots of sunshine at
the end of the week.
</p>

<p>
Many volunteers helped to make EACL 2006 successful. Thank you to all
of you! Thank you to Diana McCarthy and Shuly Wintner, the main
program chairs, and thank you to the chairs of the local organization
committee, Bernardo Magnini and Alberto Lavelli.
</p>

<p>
According to the ACL/EACL schedule, the next major ACL event in Europe
will be the ACL 2007 meeting in Prague. In 2009, we will organize the
12th conference of the European Chapter. You must have seen the call
for bids for the 2009 EACL conference, it was published just a few
weeks ago. Please consider bidding for this conference!

<h2>Report on EACL 2006</h2>

<p>
Twenty-three years after the first EACL conference in Pisa, EACL
took place again in Italy, at the beginning of April in Trento.
</p> 

<p>
Although strongly international, with 35 countries represented, the
conference retained a distinctive European flavor: 73% of the
participants (316 in total) were from Europe (23 countries), 16% from
America, 10% from Australasia and 1% from Africa.
</p> 

<p>
As usual, the event consisted of a main conference, a student research
workshop, posters, demos, 12 workshops and 4 tutorials.  For the main
conference, the acceptance rate was about 20%, while posters had an
acceptance rate of 38%. Demos had a 57% acceptance rate, whereas the
student research workshop adopted a selective 27% acceptance rate.
</p>

<h2>Report on the EACL 2006 Programme </h2>

<p>
The main conference for EACL 2006 had a 46% increase in submitted
papers compared to the 10th EACL which was held in 2003. This year we
had 264 papers submitted from 35 countries in five continents. The
large number of papers submitted, and the broad geographical basis,
demonstrate the growth in our field and considerable interest in EACL
as a truly international conference. All papers were read by a minimum
of three people, with discussions where there were differences of
opinion. The final selections were made at a one and a half-day
program committee meeting in Brighton. Of the 264 submissions, 52
papers were accepted giving an acceptance rate of 19.7%.
</p>

<p>
The conference also contained tutorials, workshops, posters, demos and
a student workshop. Keynote addresses were delivered by Kevin Knight,
of the Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern
California, and Alfonso Caramazza, of the Cognitive Neuropsychology
Laboratory, Harvard University. We would like to thank the invited
speakers, the 240 reviewers, the 10 area chairs and all authors and
participants for helping to make this conference a great success.

<h2>Second PASCAL Recognising Textual Entailment Challenge (RTE-2) Workshop</h2>
<p>
The Second PASCAL Recognising Textual Entailment Challenge (RTE-2)
Workshop was held in the beautiful venue of Venice, Italy, on April 10
(immediately following EACL), as part of the Second PASCAL Challenges
Workshop. The participation rate this year shows growing interest in
textual entailment: 23 groups, including 12 from Europe, 10 from North
America, and one from Australia, submitted to the second challenge
(35% growth), including 13 groups participating for the first time. 17
out of the 23 groups presented their systems at the workshop, and
overall about 50 people attended the workshop.
</p>
<p>
The workshop brought together researchers from various NLP
communities, such as question answering, summarization, information
extraction and semantic modeling, including academia and industry. It
provided an opportunity to share different approaches to textual
entailment, present novel ideas and discuss common issues. The results
achieved this year show considerable improvement comparing to RTE-1,
and the diversity of new approaches and research directions are very
promising for further research. Overall, it seems that both
learning-based and logic-based approaches are gradually progressing to
address semantic inference problems in a generic robust manner.
</p>
<p>
The workshop was devoted mainly to system presentations, including 6
long presentations and 11 short presentations. In addition, two panel
sessions were held, one on "Perspectives on Textual Entailment"
(panelists: Sanda Harabagiu and Ido Dagan), and the other on "Goals
and Dataset Proposals for RTE-3" (contributors: Lisa Ferro, Vasile
Rus, Anselmo Peas, Johan Bos and Nicola Stokes).
</p>
<p>
The Challenge was co-organized by Bar-Ilan University (Israel,
coordinator), CELCT (Italy), ITC-irst (Italy), Microsoft Research
(USA) and MITRE (USA).
</p>
<ul>

<h2>TALN 2006</h2>

<p>
TALN'06 (Traitement automatique des langues naturelles/Natural
language processing) took place in Leuven (Belgium) from 10th--13th
April, 2006. Initiated by Philippe Blache in 1994 and taking place on
a yearly basis, TALN has become the french speaking conference for
computational linguistics and natural language processing. Each year
it gathers between 100 and 300 researchers and industrials working in
those fields (300 when the conference is joined with the french
speaking conference for speech processing ie JEP, Journees d'Etude sur
la Parole).
</p>
<p>
As usual, this year TALN featured a rich program consisting of 34
papers, 30 posters and 9 demos. The program also included 11 student
papers, one tutorial, one workshop and two invited talks. The first
invited talk was given by Gertjan van Noord (U. of Groningen, The
Netherlands) who presented work on robust parsing for Dutch, a topic
highly relevant to the French community which like many others is
still working at developing tools and resources that have long become
standard in the english based commmunity. The second invited talk by
Thierry Fontenelle (Microsoft) focused on the linguistic correction
task in the Microsoft system.
</p>
<p>
A recent additional feature of the conference is that it has also
become a forum for presentation of national evaluation campaigns. Thus
the fourth day was devoted to the presentation and discussion of
various evaluation campaign results and of relevant new initiatives
such as the creation by the CNRS (French National Research Center) of
five Centre de Ressources Numeriques (Digitised resource centers),
several of them should contribute to the development and promotion of
freely available linguistic tools and resources for the French
language.
</p>
<p>
Previous editions of TALN have taken place in Dourdan, Fes (Maroco),
Batz-sur-mer, Nancy, Tours, Lausanne, Cargese (Corsica), Paris,
Grenoble et Marseilles (3 times). Next year TALN is already being
planned: it will take place in sunny Toulouse organised jointly by
Philippe Muller (IRIT) and Nabil Hathout (ERSS).

<h2>Acceptance Rates at ACLs</h2>
<p>
EACL 2006 had an acceptance rate of 19.7%. Many in our community feel  
that this rate is too low. This concern was made explicit in a recent  
Computational Linguistics article by Ken Church. We would like to  
address these concerns and make a few suggestions for future editions  
of EACL.
</p>
<p>
First, while the decisions on acceptance were our own (with the help  
of the 10-member Program Committee), they reflect the recommendations  
of 240 reviewers. When there is a consensus among reviewers that a  
paper is either mediocre or suffers from serious flaws, we as program  
chairs do not feel it should be accepted. If more papers are to be  
accepted, they must have better reviews. We cannot be sure that we  
did not miss some good works; but we did do our best to spot  
promising directions, even if the work described in the paper was  
preliminary.
</p>
<p>
Second, while acceptance rate indeed dropped some seven percent  
points from the last EACL, the absolute number of accepted papers was  
up from 48 to 52.
</p>
<p>
Third, acceptance rates of around 20% are common in the best  
conferences in other areas of computer science, such as theory (e.g.,  
SToC or FoCS). In areas such as computer vision or bioinformatics,  
even lower rates are common.
</p>
<p>
Still, we believe that there are ways to allow more papers into the  
program of leading conferences such as EACL. One solution is to  
provide a channel for presenting more preliminary, but highly  
innovative and original work.  This could be in the form of a  
"research notes" track, possibly with a later deadline than the main  
session (and, subsequently, fewer pages in the Proceedings). Another  
direction could be the poster session: this could be dedicated to  
works which may be of limited interest to the entire community, but  
which may be attractive to smaller groups, especially where the  
authors can benefit from the more interactive feedback that posters  
provide. In addition, the Program Committee could be given the  
prerogative to move submissions from the main session to either of  
these tracks, if it feels that a paper is more appropriate there.  
Whatever the solution, it is up to us as a community to implement: as  
reviewers, as area chairs, as program chairs but first and foremost,  
as authors.
</p>
<p>
We always welcome suggestions about how these issues might be
addressed by structuring the EACL conference programme in particular
ways.  If you have views on this, then please email Alex Lascarides
(<tt>alex@inf.ed.ac.uk</tt>).  Do *not* email Shuly Wintner or Diana McCarthy!
Your suggestions will be summarised in a future edition of the
newsletter, and also discussed at future EACL board meetings.

<h2>EACL Membership</h2>

<p>
ACL membership among countries that are in the EACL area is currently
down compared with 2005 membership by 24%: last year's total
membership was 403 while this year it's 308 (as of 9th May).  However,
the spread of membership geographically is very wide, with members
coming from 36 countries.  There are 272 members in EU countries, 14
from the middle East, 13 from Eastern Europe and 9 from other
countries (i.e,. South Africa and Switzerland).  One interesting fact
is that the proportion of student membership for this year so far is
down by a third from 2005 (from 25% to 16%).  EACL would like to
monitor this, in order to assess whether PhD recruitment in
computational linguistics is a problem in Europe, and if so whether
it's more pronounced in Europe than elsewhere.  However, given that
many people become members through their conference attendance and we
have two upcoming events (HLT/NAACL 2006 in New York and COLING/ACL
2006 in Sydney), it is highly likely that we will hit the 2005
membership totals or exceed them.

<h2>Private EACL Web Pages</h2>
<p>
The EACL Executive Board has decided to set up a private web page
from <tt>www.eacl.org</tt> for EACL officers, with the aim of collecting
and continuously maintaining a "collective memory" of policies
and practices, and a repository of reports and documents.
This ensures the information is readily available with changing
composition of the board over time.
The pages are maintained by the secretary and the Student Board.
</p>
<p>
We are currently composing an archive of previous EACL officers.
The current list is mirrored at the public EACL web site.
We invite previous members of the EACL Board to help us complete
this list, by sending a short email to secretary@eacl.org or
<tt>students@eacl.org</tt>, indicating their function and time of service.

<h2>EACL Student Sponsorships</h2>
<p>
This year, EACL is offering substantial financial support
for ESSLLI 2006, valuing 3000 Euros in total. Preference
will be given to students of Eastern European countries.
For details of application see:
<tt>http://esslli2006.lcc.uma.es/give-page.php?id=14</tt>
</p>
<p>
The EACL has also funded five students from the geographical
area of the EACL who had papers accepted at the EACL 2006
conference (in the main session, the student research workshop,
the poster/demo session, or co-located workshops).
