<P><STRONG>22nd conference on Computational Linguistics in The Netherlands</STRONG> (CLIN)
<BR> January 20, 2012
<BR> Tilburg University, The Netherlands
</P>

<P>On January 20th. 2012 the 22nd edition of the largest language technology conference of The Netherlands and the Dutch language 
region of Belgium, Flanders, took place at Tilburg University, The Netherlands. 105 researchers from both countries as well as 
from France and South-Africa attended talks about topics as diverse as spelling correction to semantic annotation, syntactical 
parsing to the study of new media. Invited speaker was Marco Baroni from the CLIC group of CIMeC, the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences 
of the University of Trento, who is an expert in distributional semantics.</P>

<P>The conferences's 60 accepted papers (from a total of 65 submissions) were organized into 3 parallel sessions covering 5 topics 
each:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>Session 1: <i>Parsing & Grammar, Machine Learning, Semantics, New Media, TT-NWW Project</i></LI>
 <LI>Session 2: <i>Spelling, Discourse, Semantic Annotation, Text Classification, Text Generation</i></LI>
 <LI>Session 3: <i>Multilinguality, Event Detection, Learning, Corpus</i></LI>
</UL>

<P>The walking lunch provided all the opportunity to sample the poster and demonstration session.</P>

<P>The organizers this year experimented with sponsors' talks. The topics of these plenary presentations were the automatic 
assignment of keywords to texts, federated search in distributed sources of linguistic information, and an overview of the new 
reference corpus for contemporary written Dutch, SoNaR. This 500MW corpus was developed during the Stevin program of the Dutch 
Language Union, together with CLARIN-NL, a major sponsor of the event. Further sponsors were the organisations BNVKI and SIKS and 
language technology companies TextKernel and Gridline. </P>

<P><STRONG>19th conference on Natural Language Processing (TALN)
<BR>25th conference on Journées d’Études sur la Parole (JEP)
<BR>17th conference of PhD Students in Natural Language Processing (RECITAL)</STRONG><BR><BR>

and their satellite workshops:<BR>
DEFT 2012: 7th French speaking Text Mining Evaluation Campaign<BR>
DEGELS 2012: 2nd workshop of the Computational tools for the French &quot;Sign Language&quot;<BR>
ILADI 2012 : 1st workshop on natural language interactions for elderly people in smart homes<BR>
ATALAf : 1st workshop on natural language (text &amp; speech) processing for African languages<BR>
June 4-8, 2012<BR>
Grenoble, France</P>

<P>For the fourth time, after Nancy in 2002, Fez in 2004, and Avignon in 2008, the AFCP (<A HREF="http://www.afcp-parole.org">Association Francophone pour la Communication Parlée</A>) and the ATALA (<A HREF="http://www.atala.org">Association pour le Traitement Automatique des Langues </A>) have jointly organized their main conference in order to bring together the two communities of speech and text processing in order to foster interactions and promote cross fertilization.</P>

<P>TALN (Traitement Automatique des Langues Naturelles) is the major
French speaking scientific event in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
and Computational Linguistics (CL). It is organized on turns by the
NLP academic teams from different universities and different French
speaking countries, after agreement by the steering committee of the
French Society for Computational Linguistics, ATALA. It aims at
presenting innovating researches and approaches in Computational
Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. It offers a unique
opportunity, for all actors of R &amp; D in NLP of the French speaking
area (France, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxemburg, Canada, and also
Northern Africa and the Middle and Far East), to meet together, and
promote their works. Students, academics and companies are invited to
participate in the conference.</P>

<P>The general atmosphere during the conference and the feedback of
the participants were both excellence. Three invited talks were
provided : Jacqueline Léon, Laboratoire d'histoire des théories
linguistiques (CNRS &amp; Université Paris Diderot), on &quot;Tensions
between theory and practice in NLP applications&quot;, Yoshinori
Sagisaka, Global Information and Telecommunication Institute (Waseda
University, Tokyo), on &quot;Trans-disciplinary spoken language
processing studies for scientific understanding of second language
learner’s characteristics&quot;, and Ian Maddieson, University of
California (Berkeley) and University of New Mexico (Albuquerque), on
&quot;The Origin and Distribution of Complexity of Phonological
Structure&quot;.</P>

<P>We received 62 long paper proposals for TALN, 24 of which were
selected through a thorough review process (a selection rate of 39%).
61 short papers were submitted of which 29 were selected through a
review process similar to that of long papers (a selection rate of
48%). As in the previous edition of TALN, short papers were presented
in oral booster sessions (2 minutes per paper) followed by poster
sessions. 10 demonstrations were also presented during a dedicated
session. 
</P>

<P>For the JEP, 145 paper proposals were received. At the end of the
review process, 108 were selected (74%). 28 paper presented in oral
sessions and 80 during poster sessions.</P>

<P>Paper submission to RECITAL has been fostered thanks to several
innovations. First, the call for papers has been extended to allow
the submission of preliminary work, PhD projects, work developed
during the first months of research (state of the art, early
results). Then, the review process has been modified to provide
educational remarks (encouragement, promising ideas) and to allow direct
interaction between the authors and the reviewers (non-anonymous
reviews). These changes were crowned with success since we received
42 proposals among which 11 have been selected for oral presentation
(27%) and 17 for poster presentation (40%).</P>

<P>As far as the conference proceedings are concerned, we have
provided new styles optimized for on screen reading. Although the
habits of authors have been changed on this occasion, we hope that
readers will have a great reading experience. A better dissemination
of the research works presented has also been of uppermost
importance, that is why we chose to have them referenced in the ACL
Anthology (aclweb.org/anthology/F/F12) for better visibility.</P>

<P>The ATALA TALN best paper award was won by the paper of Matthieu
Constant, Anthony Sigogne and Patrick Watrin <I>Modèles génératif
et discriminant en analyse syntaxique : expériences sur le corpus
arboré de Paris 7</I>. The ATALA RECITAL best paper award was won by

<H2><A NAME="konvens"></A>Report on the Conference on Natural
Language Processing (KONVENS 2012)</H2>
<P><STRONG>Conference on Natural Language Processing<BR>(&quot;Konferenz
zur Verarbeitung Natürlicher Sprache&quot;, KONVENS)</STRONG><BR>September
19-21, 2012<BR>University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria</P>
<P>The <B>Conference on Natural Language Processing</B> (&quot;Konferenz
zur Verarbeitung Natürlicher Sprache&quot;, KONVENS) aims at
offering a broad perspective on current research and developments
within the interdisciplinary field of natural language processing. It
allows researchers from all disciplines relevant to this field of
research to present their work. 
</P>
<P>KONVENS is held in a two year rotation, organized by the
scientific societies DGfS-CL (German Society for Linguistics, Section
Computational Linguistics), GSCL (Society for Language Technology and
Computational Linguistics) and ÖGAI (Austrian Society for Artificial
Intelligence).</P>
<P>This year's KONVENS, already the 11th instalment, was organized by
ÖGAI and hosted at the Juridicum building of the University of
Vienna.</P>
<P>Contributions on research, development, applications and
evaluation, covering all areas of natural language processing,
ranging from basic questions to practical implementations of natural
language resources, components and systems were welcome.</P>
<P>In keeping with the tradition, we furthermore chose a central
theme for this year's KONVENS,</P>
<P CLASS="indented">&quot;Empirical methods in natural language
processing,&quot; 
</P>
<P>and especially encouraged the submission of contributions
proposing new methods for learning from substantial amounts of
natural language (including speech) data, be they annotated or
un-annotated, as well as contributions relating to the evaluation of such
methods. 
</P>
<P>We are happy to report that we received a substantial number of
submissions relevant to the central theme, resulting in a strong and
focussed program. Overall, KONVENS received 65 submissions, 32 out of
which were selected for either oral or poster presentation at the
conference. The reviewing process was very thorough, with papers
typically receiving 3 reviews by the program committee (in borderline
cases up to 7), as well as one additional meta-review by an area
chair. We would like to express our sincere gratitude and
appreciation to everyone involved in the reviewing process. The
proceedings are published by ÖGAI and are made <A HREF="http://www.oegai.at/konvens2012/proceedings.shtml">available
online</A> in various formats. 
</P>
<P>Another decided goal for this year's KONVENS was to attract an
increasing number of international submissions. With presenters and
participants flying in from Africa, America, Asia, Near East, and all
across Europe, this goal was clearly met. Overall, KONVENS 2012 had a
total of 94 participants. Part of this success is certainly owed to
the remarkably committed organizers of the four workshops KONVENS
hosted this year, and we would like to extend our thanks to them:

<P>We are also very proud to have had <I>Hermann Ney</I> and <I>Marco
Baroni</I> as our invited speakers. Both talks provided highly
interesting perspectives on the central theme of the conference,
albeit from different points of view, and initiated vivid
discussions. 
</P>
<P>Finally, the conference dinner at a typical Austrian wine tavern
was very well received, underlining the stimulating, yet friendly and
intimate atomsphere of KONVENS.</P>
<P>We are looking forward to KONVENS 2014, to be organized by GSCL.</P>

<P><STRONG>The 2nd V&amp;L Net Workshop on Vision and Language</STRONG><BR>
December 13-14, 2012<BR>
University of Sheffield, UK</P>

<P>The 2nd V&amp;L Net Workshop on Vision and Language (VL’12) was held at the University of Sheffield on 13th and 14th December 
2012, and was attended by 50 participants.  As for VL’11, the purpose of the workshop was to bring the computer vision and language 
processing communities together and to facilitate community building and networking between them. VL’12 was organised by V&amp;L Net 
(the EPSRC Network on Vision and Language) and sponsored by the BMVA (British Machine Vision Association). </P>

<P>The programme of the first day consisted of two parallel sessions of tutorials that provided each of the two communities with the 
opportunity to learn about the main methodologies and recent developments in the other community. Three computer vision tutorials 
were aimed at participants working predominantly with language: <i>Datasets for Visual Object Recognition</i> (presented by Prof 
Chris Williams, University of Edinburgh), <i>Local Feature Extraction</i> (presented by Dr Krystian Mikolajczyk, University of 
Surrey), and <i>Machine Learning Methods for CV</i> (presented by Dr Toby Breckon, Cranfield University). Three language processing 
tutorials, primarily aimed at the computer vision researchers attending the workshop, were run at the same time: <i>Parsing and 
Analysis</i> (presented by Prof Ted Briscoe, University of Cambridge), <i>Information Retrieval/Extraction</i> (presented by Prof 
Rob Gaizauskas, University of Sheffield), and <i>Machine Translation</i> (presented by Dr Lucia Specia, University of 
Sheffield).</P>

<P>The second day was dedicated to cross-disciplinary research involving both vision and language. The first invited lecture was by 
Dr Katerina Pastra (Cognitive Systems Research Institute, Athens) who presented some of her recent work in <i>Are all verbs equal? 
Language in Action within the Embodied Cognition Perspective</i>. The second invited lecture was by Dr Peter Mika (Yahoo Inc., 
Barcelona) who represented the industrial perspective, discussing the challenges and the potential of <i>Making the Web Searchable 
with Data and Images</i>. In addition, six technical presentations and eight poster presentations discussed current and potential 
research in the intersection between the two research fields. </P>

<P>The workshop was wrapped up by an informal discussion session on the future of cross-disciplinary research between vision and 
language. Overall, the event facilitated technical dialogue and bridge building between the research areas of computer vision and 
language processing, and provided ample networking opportunities to V&L Net members and other participants.</P>

<P>We are currently in the process of putting all abstracts, slides, posters and mini-posters from the workshop <A 
HREF="http://www.vlnet.org.uk/VL-Workshop-2012.html">online</A>. </P>

<P>Forthcoming V&amp;L Net organised events in 2013 include VL’13, to be held at Herstmonceux Castle in East Sussex in September 
2013, and the V&amp;L Net Workshop on Language for Vision to be held at the 2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern 
Recognition (CVPR 2013) in Portland, Oregon, in June 2013.</P>
