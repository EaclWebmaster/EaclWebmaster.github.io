<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>You are very welcome to the EACL newsletter for year 2008 !!</p>

<p>This year too we are happy to report on several very exciting and successful events that have taken place in Europe and nearby countries.  The overall impression is that, in the Old Continent, our field is extremely active and expanding at an unprecedented rate.  We also report below on the annual meeting of ACL, which has been held this year in North America.  But first of all, let us start with some announcements of interest.</p>

<p>The 12th conference of the EACL will take place next year in Athens, Greece.  The first Call for Paper went out on March this year, and submission deadline for regular papers is very close now !!  Please read more information about this event in the note below by Alex Lascarides, EACL Chair and EACL 2009 Conference Chair.  This also includes last minute news about workshops that will be co-located with EACL 2009.</p>

<p>The EACL student board is continuously updating a very dense calendar
of events of interest to our community that will soon take place, not
limited to Europe.  The document is available in the EACL home page.
We also have a new member of the student board of EACL.  Anette Frank,
EACL Secretary, has written a welcome note for the new member,
reported below.</p>

<p>The EACL has a limited number of student sponsorships available to
student participants of the EACL 2009 main conference, the EACL 2009
poster/demo session and/or the EACL 2009 student research workshop.
Priority is given to students from Eastern Europe and, more generally,
to students from countries with hard currency problems within the
geographical area covered by EACL.  Requests for further information
about these student sponsorships can be directed to the EACL at
secretary@eacl.org.</p>

<p>This year the 46th Annual Meeting of the ACL combined with the Human
Language Technology Conference (HLT) has been jointly sponsored by the
Association for Computational Linguistics and the North American
Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics.  The
conference was held in Columbus, Ohio, and has been extremely
successful.  Kathleen McKeown, the Conference Chair, has written a
detailed report on the event, commenting on all the organizational
activities that have made it possible.</p>

<p>The 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Coling
2008, was held in Manchester, UK.  This event too has been a very
successful one.  The Program Co-Chairs, Donia Scott and Hans
Uszkoreit, have written a very interesting report on the event, which
includes several comments regarding subfield and country distributions
for the accepted papers.</p>

<p>The 6th edition of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference,
LREC 2008, organized by the European Language Resources Association,
has taken place in Marrakech (Morocco).  The Conference Chair,
Nicoletta Calzolari, and Program Committee member Khalid Choukri have
kindly written an interesting report on the event, commenting also on
the quick expansion of the area of language resources.</p>

<p>As every year, we also publish a report on the European Summer School
in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI) 2008, organized by the
Association for Logic, Language and Information.  The event took place
in Hamburg, Germany.  The Program Committee Chair, Rineke Verbrugge,
has written a detailed report, including information on country
distribution for participants.</p>

<h2>View From The Chair</h2>

<p>A year has passed since the last newsletter, and in that time EACL has
been busy preparing for EACL 2009.  The deadline for submitting papers
to the main conference is:</p>

       <p style="padding:20px;font-weight:bold;">23:59 CET on 10th October 2009.</p>

<p>I want to strongly encourage all of you to submit papers; I'm very
confident that EACL 2009 is going to be a fantastic conference.  The
local organisers, chaired by Vangelis Karkaletsis, have proved to be a
fantastic asset.  They secured for us the premier conference venue in
Greece (and at a great price!).  It's an ideal place for us to
interact and discuss our research, as well as providing a great
central base from which to explore everything that Athens has to
offer.</p>

<p>The ACL exec, the EACL board and the EACL 2009 PC chairs are all
concerned with diversifying the types of research that gets reported
in the main part of ACL conferences.  If you feel that your work
doesn't conform to the methodologies that are dominant among recent
ACL papers, or that the task that you tackle, while centred to natural
language, is in some way unusual, then please don't hesitate to submit
to EACL 2009!  The PC chairs want to encourage a broad main programme,
and together with the area chairs they will ensure that reviewing is
rigorous, with each paper being evaluated against appropriate
criteria.  A single set of rigid criteria does not fit all papers.
And changes have been made to the review form to reflect this.</p>

<p>I'm also pleased to announce that EACL 2009 will play host to the
following 10 workshops:</p>

<ol>
 <li>The Interaction between Linguistics and Computational Linguistics:<br/>
   Virtuous, Vicious or Vacuous?<br/>
   Timothy Baldwin and Valia Kordoni<br/>
   1 day
 </li>

 <li>

   Menno van Zaanen and Colin de la Higuera<br/>
   1 day
 </li>

</ol>
<p>For the first time the call for workshop proposals was coordinated
among all ACL conferences.  I think that it worked well for both the
  workshop committees and the proposers.</p>

<p>Announcements for the EACL 2009 tutorials, demos and accepted papers
will all appear in due course on the website:</p>

<h2>Report on ACL08:HLT</h2>


<p>This year's conference, ACL:HLT08, was jointly sponsored by the
Association for Computational Linguistics and the North American
Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics and it thus
brought together the traditions of both organizations. As is evident
from the title, one of those traditions is the focus on research from
all areas of Human Language Technology, including information
retrieval, natural language processing and speech. The conference
featured invited speakers in speech (Marc Swerts of Tilburg
University) and information retrieval (Susan Dumais of Microsoft
Research). There were also sessions devoted to all three of these
areas in the conference. I hope this conference has again encouraged
interaction among researchers from the different areas.</p>

<p>Since I was last involved in organizing the ACL Conferences back in
the 90's, the conferences have grown dramatically. This year there
were eight committees involved in the organization, most of which had
two or more chairs.  This included the program committee, tutorial
organizers, student research workshop, demos organizers, publications,
publicity and sponsorship.  For committees that were involved in
putting together the various aspects of the program, we had co-chairs
drawn from the three main areas of the conference. In order to
facilitate organization, in most cases, one chair was designated as
the main coordinator and that person drove the organization of their
committee, was my main contact, and communicated with the other
co-chairs. This organization worked quite well. I was quite impressed
with the energy and commitment of the different chairs. This made my
job much easier.</p>

<p>The group of volunteers included the Program Chairs, Johanna Moore,
Simone Teufel, James Allan and Sadaoki Furui, who put in many hours to
provide us with the main program for the conference and the Local
Arrangements Chair, Chris Brew, who provided us with the venue for the
conference overseeing the many time-demanding details. The webmaster
was DJ Hovermale, who put in many hours aggregating information from
everyone.  The Chairs of the Student Research Workshop, Ebru Arisoy,
Wolfgang Maier and Keisuke Inoue, worked quite independently, along
with the Faculty Advisor, Jan Wiebe, putting together an excellent
student research session . The Workshop Chair, Ming Zhou managed the
workshop program with ease, a program that has grown over the years so
that it seems like a conference in and of itself. The Tutorial Chairs,
Ani Nenkova, Marilyn Walker and Eugene Agichtein have put together a
fine tutorial program and the Demo Chair, Jimmy Lin, has organized a
nice series of demos. The Sponsorship Chairs are responsible for
bringing in funding to cover various programs and Inderjeet Mani,
Josef van Genabith and Michael White put serious effort into raising
funds for the conference.  The Publicity Chairs, Hal Daume, Eric
Fosler-Lussier and Diane Kelly, reached out to communities outside the
central natural language areas to encourage people to submit papers
and attend the conference. Finally, the Publication Chairs, Joachim
Nivre and Noah Smith, were very organized and handily managed the job
of pulling all materials together for the main conference and workshop
proceedings, no small feat.</p>

<p>There were several other changes that we tried this year. A new plan
for sponsorship was developed that would enable coordination among
different ACL Conferences and across the years. This plan was
finalized during the summer and thus, relatively late in the process
of selecting chairs. It is an ambitious plan and we are fortunate to
have one person who has agreed to serve in a multi-year,
multi-conference capacity. However, finding people who are willing to
serve in this larger capacity is difficult. I think the next
conference chair needs to start finding people early for this task and
the ACL should think about how to make the task more rewarding.</p>

<p>We also instituted a change this year in the number of publication
chairs. In previous years, there was only one and this year, we
expanded that number to two. I think this change worked well. The task
was divided by proceedings with Joakim Nivre handling the main
proceedings and Noah Smith handling the workshop proceedings. Given
the number of workshops, I think an extra person was needed to handle
this. We also made it possible for them to find help within their
local institutions, something that is also needed for this particular
job. There was a fair amount of communication between the publication
chairs to various other chairs and the publishers. I found that it
seamlessly switched between Joakim and Noah and that when one was
unavailable, the other would easily substitute. So I would recommend
again having two publications chairs in future years.</p>

<p>This year the number of student paper submissions was lower than usual
and for future years, I would recommend asking the student research
chairs to think about how to publicize. This was unexpected this year
so we did not think of doing this ahead of time. Faculty at different
universities should keep in mind that with a lower number of
submissions, there is a better chance for the students to have papers
accepted. The student papers are presented in a parallel track as are
all other papers and students will have equal exposure.</p>

<p>In addition to the many Chairs, there are several individuals within
the ACL organization itself who deserve recognition.  First and foremost,
Dragomir Radev provided guidance about what to do next at every step
and had the answer to every question I had within seconds. Owen Rambow
also provided much needed advice from the perspective of the North
American Chapter. Priscilla Rasmussen is critical to the running of
the conference, with her organizational history of how things work.
The ACL also has a Coordinating Committee which oversees the
conference organization, providing advice when needed.</p>

<h2>Report on Coling 2008</h2>


<p>COLING 2008, the 22nd International Conference on Computational
Linguistics was held in Manchester, UK in August. It was the first
COLING conference in the UK, a country with a rich history and lively
research scene in Computational Linguistics.  The great response to
the call for papers may have been caused by this location or it may
just have been a consequence of the rapid growth of our discipline. In
any case, the 600 submissions of high average quality we received made
it relatively easy for the program committee to put together an
excellent program (see <a href="http://www.coling2008.org.uk/">http://www.coling2008.org.uk/</a>).</p>


<p>The Programme:</p>

<p>COLING'08 attracted 600 submissions of papers, posters and demos.  Of
these 48 were not reviewed because they were either withdrawn or
rejected for failing to meet the the submission requirements. The
geographical profile of the remaining submissions was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>91 United States</li>
  <li>90 Japan</li>
  <li>60 China</li>
  <li>53 United Kingdom</li>
  <li>41 Germany</li>
  <li>32 France</li>
  <li>18 Spain</li>
  <li>16 India</li>
  <li>13 Taiwan Province of China</li>
  <li>12 Republic of Korea</li>
  <li>11 Canada, Australia</li>
  <li>10 Italy</li>
  <li>9 Netherlands, Israel, Ireland</li>
  <li>8 Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China</li>
  <li>7 Singapore</li>
  <li>6 Switzerland, Belgium</li>
  <li>5 Thailand, Sweden</li>
  <li>3 Romania, Portugal</li>
  <li>2 Macau, Greece, Finland, Brazil</li>
  <li>1 Turkey, South Africa, Slovenia, Russian Federation,
        Poland, Mexico, Malaysia, Luxembourg, Lithuania,
        Jordan, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Denmark, Czech Republic,
        Cuba, Bulgaria, Bangladesh</li>
</ul>
<p>After a thorough reviewing process including a period of interactive
deliberation, the program committee selected 146 full papers and 36
poster presentations. The central criterion for the selection was
scientific quality rather than geographic balance or the desirable
spread across subareas. We tried to apply a multidimensional concept
of quality that does not exclusively favour technically sound
engineering papers but also yields some space for challenging
scientific insights and first reports on novel approaches.</p>

<p>Looking at the distribution of the papers among subfields of CL, we
made a few observations. One concerns the central theme of machine
learning. Although the term machine learning only appears in the name
of one single session, machine learning actually transcends nearly all
represented subfields of our discipline.</p>

<p>After decades of hibernation, the area of machine translation has
again become a central field of research. Almost all of the MT related
submissions are on statistical translation but a growing number of
papers describes clever combinations of methods from different
paradigms. Compared with MT, the area of natural language generation
is much less represented, which may partially be due to this year's
International Language Generation Conference in Ohio.</p>

<p>The area of information extraction still keeps growing. With subareas
such as opinion mining, sentiment detection and event extraction it
has become rather diversified.</p>

<p>A special observation concerns specialised types of phrase
disambiguation or classification that cannot easily be subsumed under
IR or IE since the described methods could also be utilised for
summarisation, paraphrasing or other application types.  In general it
has become harder to assign method papers to just one traditional
technology area.  This is nicely reflected in the authors' choice of
multiple keywords from different areas.</p>

<p>We only received few submissions on speech technologies, in our
opinion even less than in earlier COLING conferences. Although this
development might simply be attributed to the inevitable and ever
progressing differentiation of the human language technologies, it may
also be the case that the meeting market in this area is well covered
by the well known speech conferences. This year's ACL conference also
had just a single speech processing session.</p>

<p>We hope that our colleagues will forgive us for having been rather
strict with double submissions. In several cases accepted submissions
were finally turned down because a paper with largely overlapping
content had appeared or was scheduled to appear elsewhere (We also had
to turn down a number of papers that were not anonymised). We believe
that our field has to find a proper way of dealing with the increasing
number of professional conferences without sacrificing the basic
principles of scientific publishing.</p>

<p>We were privileged to have keynote addresses by two leading scientists
in related areas: Elizabeth Shriberg (SRI and Berkeley) on Challenges
to Using Prosody in Automatic Language Processing and John
Shawe-Taylor (UCL) on Machine Learning for multimodal analysis.</p>

<p>After deciding to enrich this Conference with a Best COLING Paper
Award, we received an offer from the renowned scientific publishing
house Springer to support such an award. We are grateful to Springer
for this generous donation and thank especially Olga Chiarcos for her
efforts in this case.  The Best COLING Paper Award went to Bill
MacCartney and Christopher Manning for their paper on "Modeling
Semantic Containment and Exclusion in Natural Language Inference". We
encourage you all to read it, and the other papers. The COLING 2008
proceedings are already included in the ACL Anthology!</p>

<p>Together with Olga Chiarcos we also thought about means for making
COLING even more attractive and visible. Olga proposed a special book
publication of selected ground-breaking COLING papers in their
extended versions.  This is an excellent idea which is being
implemented already for this COLING conference.</p>

<p>The geographical profile of the accepted submissions was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>62 Japan</li>
  <li>48 United States</li>
  <li>43 China</li>
  <li>31 United Kingdom</li>
  <li>28 Germany</li>

  <li>13 Spain</li>
  <li>12 Republic of Korea</li>
  <li>11 Taiwan Province of China, India</li>
  <li>8 Italy</li>
  <li>6 Israel, Canada, Australia</li>
  <li>5 Switzerland, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China</li>
  <li>4 Thailand, Ireland, Belgium</li>
  <li>3 Sweden, Singapore, Portugal, Netherlands</li>
  <li>2 Romania, Macau, Greece, Brazil</li>
  <li>1 Turkey, South Africa, Slovenia, Russian Federation,
        Mexico, Malaysia, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Jordan,
        Iran (Islamic Republic of), Cuba, Bulgaria, Bangladesh</li>
</ul>

<p>The conference attracted 421 attendees from 37 countries. The
breakdown for this is:</p>

<ul>

<p>We want to thank the area chairs who steered the reviewing process to
a fruitful end, and to acknowledge the successful work of our numerous
colleagues who acted as reviewers. Our special gratitude goes to Roger
Evans for his hard and uncompromising work on the proceedings and
Christian Spurk for the excellent technical support he gave to the
Programme Committee. We would also like to thank the local organizer
Harold Somers for providing such a good venue, outing and banquet, for
his hard work in achieving this, and for his constructive cooperation
with the Programme Committee.</p>

<p>COLING 2010 will be in Beijing.  We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<h2>Report on LREC 2008</h2>


<p>LREC, launched in 1998 in Granada as a visionary idea of Antonio
Zampolli and other colleagues, celebrated its tenth birthday in the
wonderful city of Marrakech. The conference had the honour of
receiving the Royal Patronage of His Majesty Mohammed VI, King of
Morocco, highlighting the importance assigned to multilingual and
multicultural issues.</p>

<p>This year LREC broke many records: we accepted 645 papers out of the
more than 900 submissions, and we had over 1,100 participants from all
continents. In addition, over 30 satellite events such as tutorials
and workshops took place, increasing the chances of discussion and
exchange. These figures indicate the great vitality of the broad area
of Language Resources (LR) and Evaluation and bear witness to the
existence of a strong LR community.</p>

<p>The conference was organised by ELRA (the European Language Resources
Association) in cooperation with a wide range of international
associations and organisations. Since its creation in 1995, ELRA has
focused its activities on LRs and Evaluation and the need for common
sharing and utilization of the LRs that are required for R&D
activities in the Human Language Technology communities.</p>

<p>LREC has become an important observation post for feeling the pulse of
today's initiatives in the field, with the possibility not just of
listening to the ``best or most innovative'' method or technique, but
of examining the wide diversity of approaches, the variety of
resources for many languages including ``minority'' ones, new emerging
trends, large projects, initiatives and infrastructures. This
broadness of themes, topics and perspectives is an essential
contribution towards forming a better global vision of our field and
thus stimulating new ideas.</p>

<p>We no longer have to defend or promote the data-driven approaches:
they are pervasive and have a well-deserved and ample recognition as
the necessary infrastructure underlying Language Technology (LT). It
is the merit (mostly) of LRs that LT acquires the maturity and attains
the robustness needed to be truly usable in applications with a great
impact in the society.</p>

<p>The consistent growth of the field brings in itself some sort of
revolution, and the need for convergence of the many communities now
acting separately, such as LR and LT developers, text, speech and
multimodal specialists, terminology, semantic web and ontology
experts, content providers, linguists and so on. The achievement of a
worldwide linguistic infrastructure, however, requires the coverage
not only of a range of technical aspects, but also -- and maybe most
critically -- of a number of organisational aspects. This is one of
the challenges for the immediate future, for a usable and useful
language scenario in the global and multilingual network. LREC plays
an important role in the integration of these various
communities. This explosion of the field does not mean that there are
no infrastructural issues still to be discussed and solved. Important
examples are the problem of LR maintenance, or the critical issues of
interoperability and sharing: some interesting debates took place
during different panels highlighting these aspects (e.g., panel on
data centre missions).</p>

<p>The continuous evolution of the field should also be complemented by a
reflection on priorities and future strategies. The fact that a number
of strategic-infrastructural initiatives are now being launched in all
the continents represents an enormous achievement and opportunity. It
is a sign that funding agencies recognise the strategic value of our
work and the importance of helping coherent growth through a number of
coordinated actions. LREC, together with its workshops, is the place
where these -- and future -- initiatives are presented, discussed,
and promoted.</p>

<p>LREC 2008 Proceedings, together with the proceedings of the
accompanying workshops, are now available on the web, and also those
of past LRECs will be soon made available as a service to the
community and indexed in the ACL Anthology.</p>

<h2>Report on ESSLLI 2008</h2>


<p>The 20th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
took place at the University of Hamburg, Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg,
4-15 August, 2008. The summer school offered 40 courses, as usual
divided into three levels (foundational, introductory and advanced)
and three tracks (language and logic, logic and computation, and
language and computation). The courses were accompanied by 8 workshops
and 4 evening lectures.</p>

<p>The Language and Computation track gave courses on, for example,
negative polarity items, dialogue systems, statistical machine
translation, grammar induction and language evolution, the
syntax-semantics interface, unification grammars, etc. One of the
evening lectures, 'Teaching grammars to computers' was also devoted to
Language and Computation. A number of these events was filmed by EACL.</p>

<p>This years summer was attended by the stunning number of around 460
students and lecturers from 43 countries. The biggest national
delegations were Germany (21%), the Netherlands (17%), the United
Kingdom (11%), France (9%), Italy (7%) and the USA (6%). Other double
digit delegations were Japan (11 participants), South Korea and
Belgium (10 participants each).</p>

<p>The teaching and learning were complemented by a soccer match among
student teams, weekend excursions to the Hamburg harbor and to Lubeck,
canoeing, a party, and other joys of Hamburg. This year for the first
time, a music room, complete with harpsichord, was reserved for
ESSLLI, and throughout the two weeks summer school a number of
participants enjoyed the possibility to join others in playing chamber
music.</p>
