<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>Welcome to the EACL newsletter for year
2009. In the time that has passed since the last issue, several exciting events
related to our community have taken place in Europe and the world. We are
reporting on this below. But first of all, let us start with some announcements
of interest. </span></p>

<p>The 12th conference of the EACL has taken
place this year in Athens, Greece. Alex Lascarides, EACL's former chair,
reports on this important event below. Meanwhile we are planning EACL 2012, for
which we have received three bids. We are curious about the outcome. </span></p>

<p>Some new people have joined the advisory
board and the student board of EACL. Joakim Nivre, EACL's secretary, has
written a welcome section introducing the new members. </span></p>

<p>To start with our list of events, this
year we have had a very exciting edition of the ACL 2009 conference, which was
jointly hosted by ACL and IJCNLP. The conference was held in Singapore. This
newsletter contains a detailed report about the conference, written by Keh-Yih Su, General
Chair of ACL-IJNLP-09. We also have a report on RANLP 2009, which took place
in  Borovets, Bulgaria, written by Galia Angelova, Chair of the Organising
Committee, and Ruslan Mitkov, Chair of the Programme Committee. Finally, we report
on ESSLLI'09, which took place in Bordeaux, France, written by Uwe Mönnich,
Chair of the ESSLLI'09 programme committee. </span></p>

<p> As every year, the student
board has carefully edited a dense calendar of events of interest that will
soon take place, not limited to Europe. The document is now available in the
EACL home page, and we provide a link at the end of the newsletter. The
calendar will be continuously updated in the months to come. </span></p>

<h2>View From The Chair</span></h2>

<p>In the year that has just passed since
the last newsletter, EACL has been involved in several main activities: the
computational linguistics field is extremely active and expanding at an
unprecedented rate in the Old Continent, and the EACL board has been kept very
busy.  At the same time, the board needs to be very attentive to these changes
and new opportunities.  I will not report here on all of the board most recent
activities, projects and discussions, since the list is too long.  But I do
want to focus on two main issues regarding conference activities.</span></p>

<p>First of all, in year 2010 Europe is
hosting the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics, which will be held jointly with EACL in Uppsala, Sweden, on July
11–16.  The conference is being organized by the Department of Linguistics and
Philology at Uppsala University, and will take place at Uppsala University
Campus, in a genuine university environment, dating back as far as 1477.  The
city also holds a rich history, having for long periods been the political,
religious and academic center of Sweden.  The local organisers, chaired by
Joakim Nivre, are doing a fantastic job to provide a perfect setting for this
conference.</span></p>

<p>The ACL exec, the EACL board and the ACL
2010 PC chairs have all been concerned with diversifying the types of research
that will be represented at the ACL 2010 main programme. If you feel that your
work doesn't conform to the methodologies that are dominant among recent ACL
papers, but is nonetheless centered to important themes in natural language,
then please don't hesitate to submit to ACL 2010! The PC chairs are doing their
best to provide a broad main programme and, together with the area chairs, they
will ensure that reviewing is rigorously evaluated against appropriate
criteria.  To this end, significant changes have been made to the review form,
to reflect the fact that a single set of rigid criteria cannot fit all papers. 
I want to strongly encourage all of you to submit your best works to this
conference!</span></p>

<p>As a second issue, in 2009 we have had
the 12th Conference of EACL, which took place in Athens from March 30th to
April 3rd 2009. As you will read from the report by the general conference
chair Alex Lascarides below, this has been an extremely successful event, the
largest EACL ever with over 500 people registered and with a record in both
number of paper submissions and papers presented in the main conference
programme.</span></p>

<p>For the first time in the history of EACL
conferences, in addition to papers being presented through the usual 25 minute
talks, at EACL 2009 several main conference papers were delivered via posters
plus a 10 minute talk.  Apart from the presentation mode, these two kinds of
papers have had the same status within the conference programme, and no
distinction has been made in the conference proceedings between them.  This
change has been very well received by people attending the conference.  EACL
intends to experiment with this in the future editions of the conference.</span></p>

<p>To conclude, some acknowledgments.  There
have been a number of changes among EACL's board members.  I would like to express
the warmest welcome on board to chair-elect Sien Moens, secretary Joakim Nivre,
advisory board member Toni Marti, and student board members Marta Recasens
Potau and Mattias Nilsson. At the same time I would like to thank Alex
Lascarides, Anette Frank, Paola Merlo, Vera Demberg and Yanjun Ma, whose tenure
on the board has ceased at the beginning of year 2009.  A very special personal
thank you to Alex Lascarides, the former EACL chair, for her fantastic work in
guiding the EACL board in the past years, and for her continuous help with
several EACL matters.  Alex: I hope I have learned from you!</span></p>

<h2>Report on EACL 2009</span></h2>

<p>EACL 2009 took place in Athens from March
30th to April 3rd 2009. It consisted of four tutorials, ten workshops and a
main conference programme, including a student research workshop and demos
session. It was the largest EACL ever, with over 500 people registered and also
with more papers presented than ever before in the main conference programme.
Organising such a big conference takes a massive number of volunteers. There
were some eight committees of varying size dealing with: the main programme,
the demo sessions, student research workshop, tutorials, workshops,
sponsorship, publications and last but definitely not least local organisation.
As general chair, I was blessed with fantastic people on all these committees,
making my job ridiculously easy. I'm very grateful to them all.</span></p>

<p>Joakim Nivre and Claire Gardent, the
programme chairs, worked hard to design both the call for papers and the
reviewing process so as to encourage a more diverse technical programme than we
have seen in recent ACLs and EACLs. For the first time, EACL main conference
papers were delivered via posters plus a 10 minute talk, as well as via the
usual 25 minute talks. This enabled us to increase the acceptance rate without
stretching the conference out into a 10 day event! Also, for the first time in
ACL's history, the proceedings did not include the schedule. This was done
deliberately, so that on cannot tell from the proceedings itself whether a
paper was presented as a 25 minute talk or as a poster. This is designed to
remove the usual stigma that goes with presenting a poster. I found the poster
session to be highly stimulating, and I very much hope that future EACLs will
continue to experiment with it.</span></p>

<p>The tutorial programme was especially strong this year, but unfortunately 
the take up from attendees was very low in
spite of this. In future, EACL should perhaps consider how they want to take
the tutorial programme forward. For instance, it may be necessary to avoid a
schedule clash with workshops, much like ACL conferences do.</span></p>

<p>The conference venue was extremely grand, and also expensive! So in spite of the
highest ever income from registrations together with the highest ever income
from local sponsorship (thanks to the talented Vangelis Karkaletsis and Stelios
Piperidis more than doubling their target), we made a very tiny profit. But the
conference setting was fantastic, and I feel sure that almost everyone who
attended appreciated the surroundings.</span></p>

<p>I need to give a special mention to the
local organising team, who were excellent in every way and a total pleasure to
work with. The local chair Vangelis Karkaletsis, the co-chairs Ion
Androutsopoulos and Stelios Piperidis and their extensive team of volunteers
(both staff and students) worked for over two years on an overwhelming number
of tasks, ranging from liaising with the conference venue to catering,
printing, publicity and local sponsorship. They dealt brilliantly with every
problem that was flung at them, including a general strike in Athens on day 3
of the conference. One cannot wish for a better team of people. I owe them a
massive debt.</span></p>

<h2>Report on ACL-IJCNLP-09</span></h2>

<p>ACL-IJCNLP-09 was held in Singapore
during 2-7 August, 2009. This is the first joint conference sponsored by ACL
(The Association for Computational Linguistics) and AFNLP (Asian Federation of
Natural Language Processing). The idea to have a joint conference between ACL
and AFNLP was first discussed at ACL-05 (Ann Arbor, Michigan) between Martha
Palmer, Benjamin Tsou, Jun’ichi Tsujii and Keh-Yih Su (who were ACL President,
AFNLP President, Vice President, and Conference Coordinating Committee Chair,
also the Secretary General, respectively, at that time). We are glad that the
original idea has become true four years later and even the affiliation
relationship between these two organizations has been built up now.</span></p>

<p>In this joint conference, we have tried to mix the spirit from both 
ACL and AFNLP (we have one co-chair from Asia and
one co-chair from US/Europe for each position, except the general chair), and
Singapore, which itself has mixed cultures from various Eastern and Western
regions, is certainly a wonderful place to see how different languages meet
each other. The conference organizers are as follows: Jan Wiebe and Jian Su
(Program Chairs), Haizhou Li (Local Arrangements Chair), Minghui Dong
(Webmaster), Gary Geunbae Lee and Sabine Schulte im Walde (Demo Chairs),
Timothy Baldwin and Philipp Koehn (Exhibits Chairs), Hwee Tou Ng and Florence
Reeder (Mentoring Service Chairs), Jing-Shin Chang and Regina Barzilay
(Publication Chairs), Min-Yen Kan and Andy Way (Publicity Chairs), Hitoshi
Isahara and Kim-Teng Lua (Sponsorship Chairs), Davis Dimalen, Jenny Rose Finkel,
and Blaise Thomson (Student Research Workshop Chairs), Grace Ngai and Brian
Roark (Faculty Advisors), Diana McCarthy and Chengqing Zong (Tutorial Chairs),
Jimmy Lin and Yuji Matsumoto (Workshop Chairs), and Priscilla Rasmussen (ACL
Business Manager). </span></p>

<p>Despite the bad global economic situation
and the H1N1 threat, we still got total 925 submissions this year (which is
record high<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=FootnoteCharacters><span class=FootnoteCharacters><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>).
Among them, 569 were full paper submissions (99 + #ACL-08), and 120 of them
were accepted (21%); 356 were short paper submissions (81 + #ACL-08), and 93 of
them were accepted (26%). These data definitely show that our field keeps
growing. Those accepted main conference papers were presented in 4 parallel
tracks. Besides, we organised 6 half-day tutorials, 12 workshops (2 days), and
4 parallel tracks for EMNLP (2 days). Furthermore, two invited talks were given
by Prof. Qiang Yang (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong)
for “Heterogeneous Transfer Learning with Real-world Applications”, and Prof.
Bonnie Webber (University of Edinburgh, UK) for “Discourse - Early problems,
current successes, future challenges”. Both talks got warm response from the
audiences.</span></p>

<p>About the social events, the welcome
reception was held during the eve of the main conference, and started with a
very fascinating Chinese Lion Dancing; also, the banquet was held at the second
day of the main conference with various performances related to different local
cultures (including Chinese, India and Malay, etc).  Prof. Key-Sun Choi, the
AFNLP president, gave his presidential speech first when the banquet began, and
then Prof. Steven Bird, the ACL president, gave his speech at the end of
banquet. In addition to giving his presidential address, Steven also shown the
musical talent by playing his guitar for various kinds of music. Many people
took this chance to relax themselves by joining the after banquet dance.</span></p>

<p>In the last day of the main conference,
the life time achievement award was given to Prof. Frederick Jelinek, for his
great contribution to speech recognition and statistical MT. Besides, three
best paper awards are given in the closing session: “Concise Integer Linear
Programming Formulations for Dependency Parsing” (Andre Martins, Noah Smith and
Eric Xing), “Reinforcement Learning for Mapping Instructions to Actions”
(S.R.K. Branavan, Harr Chen, Luke Zettlemoyer and Regina Barzilay), and “K-Best
A* Parsing” (Adam Pauls and Dan Klein). Besides, Andre Martins, S.R.K. Branavan
and Adam Pauls have received the best student paper awards sponsored by IBM.</span></p>

<p>According to the statistics of August 5,
2009 we registered 850 participants for the main conference and 315
registrations for EMNLP. Many conference participants have expressed that they
really enjoyed this latter conference, which not only has high quality
technical presentations, but also has interesting social activities, and regard
this conference as a very successful one.</span></p>

<h2>Report on RANLP 2009</span></h2>

<p>The biennial conference Recent Advances
in Natural Language Processing (RANLP) has established itself as one of the
leading international conferences in Natural Language Processing, Computational
Linguistics and Language Technology. The conference is preceded by tutorials
and followed by workshops. This year RANLP 2009 featured also a student
research workshop. The RANLP conferences continue the tradition of the international summer schools in
computational linguistics held in Bulgaria since 1989. Since its first edition in
1995, the conference has grown from strength to strength, attracting leading
researchers from all over the world. RANLP is cited as one of the most
successful events among Computer Science conferences
(<a href="http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/conferencerankings/alltopics.html">Conference Rankings</a>, updated February 2009)
<!-- (http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/conferencerankings/alltopics.html, updated February 2009) --> . 
One of the distinctive features of the conference is
the fact that keynote speakers (6 for each conference) represent leading lights
in the field. </span></p>

<p>The papers accepted at the conference are
reviewed by a Programme Committee consisting of well-known experts with the
acceptance rate being very competitive. In terms of acceptance rate of regular
papers, RANLP 2009 reported an acceptance rate as low as 13%!  This year 87
papers were presented at the conference (as regular, short or poster papers),
authored by researchers from 28 countries.RANLP 2009 and its associated events
were held in the Rila mountain resort Borovets, Bulgaria in the period 12-18
September 2009.  Keynote speakers at RANLP 2009 gave six invited talks:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li> Ricardo Baeza-Yates (<i>Towards Semantic Search</i>),</li>
  <li> Kevin Bretonnel Cohen  (<i>Paradigms for Evaluation in Natural Language Processing</i>),</li>
  <li> Walter Daelemans (<i>Robust features for Computational Stylometry</i>),</li>
  <li> Mirella Lapata (<i>Vector-based Models of Semantic Composition</i>),</li>
  <li> Shalom Lappin  (<i>Restricting Probability Distributions to Expand the Class of Learnable Languages</i>), </li>
  <li> Massimo Poesio (<i>Conceptual Knowledge: Evidence from Corpora and the Brain</i>), </li>

<p>whereas tutorial speakers and titles were:</span></p>

 <li> Kevin Bretonnel Cohen (<i>Biomedical Natural Language Processing: BioNLP</i>),</li>
 <li> Roberto Navigli (<i>Graph-Based Word Sense Disambiguation and Discrimination</i>),</li>
 <li> Constantin Orasan (<i>Automatic Summarisation in the Information Age</i>) and</li>
 <li> Kiril Simov &amp; Petya Osenova (<i>In the NLP world of Knowledge Nets</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The following workshops were accepted and held at RANLP’2009:  </span></p>

<ul>
<li> <i>Multilingual Resources, Technologies and Evaluation for Central and Eastern European Languages</i>
(organised by Cristina Vertan, Stelios Piperidis, Elena Paskaleva and Milena
Slavcheva),</li>

<li> <i> Adaptation of  Language Resources and Technology to New Domains</span></i>
(organised by Nuria Bel, Erhard Hinrichs, Kiril Simov and Petya Osenova),</li>

<li> <i>Natural Language Processing Methods and Corpora in Translation, Lexicography, and Language Learning</i> 
(organised by Viktor Pekar, Iustina Narcisa Ilisei, and Silvia Bernardini),</li>

<li> <i>Events in Emerging Text Types </i> (organised
by Constantin Orasan, Laura Hasler and Corina Forascu),</li>

<li> <i> First Workshop on Definition Extraction</span></i> (organised by Gerardo Eugenio Sierra Martinez), </li

<li> <i> Biomedical Information Extraction</i>
(organised by Guergana Savova, Vangelis Karkaletsis and Galia Angelova) and </li>

<li> <i> Student Research Workshop</i> (organised
by Irina Temnikova, Ivelina Nikolova and Natalia Konstantinova).</li>

</ul>

<p>One of the historical values of RANLP is
that it has traditionally been an important meeting point between the East and
the West; this was the place where students from young democratic Eastern
Europe had the chance to meet leading NLP researchers.</span></p>

<p>The informal team behind RANLP consists
of Bulgarians, working based in different countries and includes Galia
Angelova  (Organising Committee Chair), Kalina Bontcheva, Ruslan Mitkov
(Programme Committee Chair), Nicolas Nicolov, and Nikolai Nikolov.  Kiril Simov
was the workshop coordinator and Ivelina Nikolova was the Programme Committee
Coordinator.  The Committee was also supported by Irina Temnikova and Natalia
Konstantinova.</span></p>

<h2>Report on ESSLLI 2009</span></h2>

<p>On July 31, 2009 one of the most successful summer schools came to its conclusion, ending two weeks of
stimulating courses, workshops and public lectures that make this gathering
into such a significant event. The European Summer School in Logic, Language
and Information (ESSLLI) has for more than two decades served as a meeting
point where students, researchers from academe and industry and participants
from business exchange ideas, learn about new and established topics mentioned
in the title of the school and, generally, face the challenge of exploring the
interface of distinct scientific constituencies.</span></p>

<p>This interdisciplinary European summer
school is organized every year by the Association for Logic, Language and
Information (FoLLI) in different sites around Europe. Its 21st instalment took
place at the university of Bordeaux. During the two weeks from July 20 to July
31 the participants could choose among 47 foundational, introductory and
advanced courses as well as workshops covering a variety of topics at the
interface of the three areas of focal interest: Language and Computation,
Language and Logic, and Logic and Computation.</span></p>

<p>Previous summer schools have been highly
successful, attracting up to 500 students from mainly Europe, but also the
America’s, Asia, Australia, and recently Africa. The current economic crisis
and the coincidence with other important conferences were expected to result in
a depletion of inscription figures. It testifies to the extraordinary
attraction of the school that this expectation turned out to be unfounded. This
year again, more than 500 participants gathered in Bordeaux. The school was
hosted by a large and efficient organizing committee, led by Christian Retore
(chair) and Richard Moot (local co-chair).</span></p>

<p>The school’s operating budget came
largely from inscription fees paid by the participants, with additional funding
from academic institutions, international organizations (including EACL), local
business and communal services. As in the past, all teaching and organizing at
the summer school was done on a voluntary basis. Lecturers and workshop
organizers were not paid for their contribution, but were reimbursed for part
of their travel and accommodation cost. This financial policy made it possible
to keep the inscription fees at a record low this year.</span></p>

<p>In spite of these economic restrictions
lecturers and workshop organizers jockeyed hard for participation. The response
to the call for proposals was overwhelming and the programme committee was
confronted with nearly three times as many submissions as could be accepted for
the tight schedule of the school. This undiminished interest of highly
qualified scholars to attend the school as lecturer or organizer is a
reflection of the high quality of the student participants and of the fact that
it counts as an endorsement of someone’s academic standing to be accepted as a
teacher at ESSLLI.</span></p>

<p>Even though the school has maintained its
interdisciplinary focus during its distinguished history, over the years its
profile has shifted in reaction to emerging priorities in scientific
developments and in response to prominent research done at the hosting
institution and in the hosting country. In the case of the Bordeaux event this
was illustrated by particularly stimulating courses and workshops in the fields
of quantitative computational linguistics, sign languages, semantics and
pragmatics of vagueness, logics for social concepts and frameworks for
grammatical descriptions, to name just a few highlights.</span></p>

<p>Another constitutive feature of ESSLLI is
the student session that is organized as a separate slot and which was held
every day of the summer school. This event enabled master students and
beginning PhD students to present their work to a knowledgeable audience of
fellow students and senior researchers. It is worth mentioning that many of the
teachers in Bordeaux had started their career as presenters at student sessions
in previous years.</span></p>

<p>In addition to the workshops and courses
the tradition of evening lectures was continued in Bordeaux with four talks in
which prominent researchers talked on actual issues at the forefront of
research in their fields. The hosting country was represented by presentations
given by A. Abeillé on the project of the Grande Grammaire du Français and by
B. Courcelle on context-free graph grammars. N. Chater discussed the question
of why language acquisition is possible and Y. Moschovakis outlined his
approach towards English as a programming language.</span></p>

<p>A summer school would be incomplete
without a social programme. Bordeaux with its restored centre on the UNESCO
World Heritage list and its famous vineyards provided ample opportunities for
excursions both into the world of architecture and of culinary excellence. The
organizing committee went out of their way in providing information material
and in arranging bus trips to the vineyards.</span></p>

<p>With hindsight, this year’s ESSLLI in
Bordeaux has been an outstanding platform for students to become acquainted
with new and established fields of research and for senior scholars to exchange
ideas on recent developments in the areas of logic, language and information.
Bordeaux has successfully continued the tradition of this annual gathering at
the interface of activities that are covered by the nowadays slightly
old-fashioned term ‘cognitive science’. The two weeks of the summer school
concluded with an invitation to meet again next year in Copenhagen, August, 9
-- 20. Vincent Hendricks acts as chair of the organizing committee of ESSLLI
2010, the chair of the programme committee is Valentin Goranko. </span></p>
