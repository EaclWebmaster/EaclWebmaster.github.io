<h2> 1. Editorial </h2>

<p> Welcome to the EACL newsletter for 2012. The newsletter starts with a
message from the chair of EACL, Sien Moens. I give a short report on
the progress being made for EACL 2014, to be held in Gothenburg,
Sweden, and then we have a series of reports on the various
international conferences in Computational Linguistics held in 2012. </p>

<p> The Student Board has again carefully edited a dense calendar of
European and international events of interest that will soon take
place. The document is available via the EACL home page. </p>

<h2> 2. View from the Chair </h2>

<p> This newsletter looks back to the 2012 conferences in the field of
Computational Linguistics and especially those held in Europe. </p>

<p> The 13th Conference of EACL (EACL 2012), which was the main EACL event
of 2012, took place in Avignon from April 23-27. The conference was
chaired by Walter Daelemans and the local organization committee was
headed by Marc El-Beze. As you will read from the report by the
program chairs Lluiz Marquez and Mirella Lapata, the conference was
very successful and there were about 450 participants, which is very
good in a year when many computational linguistics conferences took
place. </p>

<p> But let us look ahead. In 2013 Europe will be hosting the 51st Annual
Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2013),
which will be held in Sofia, Bulgaria on August 4-9 and will be
organized by the Department of Computational Linguistics, Institute
for Bulgarian Language and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. The
general chair is Hinrich Schuetze and the local chair is Svetla
Koeva. Meanwhile we are very busy preparing the 14th Conference of the
European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics
(EACL 2014), which will be held in Gothenburg, Sweden from 26 till 30
April, 2014. </p>

<p> Computational linguistics definitely has a place in Europe. This is
also witnessed by the recent EU project calls in the FP7 framework
focusing on language technology. We sincerely hope that the interest
in this exiting multidisciplinary field continues to flourish in the
coming decades and stays on the research agenda of the European
Horizon 2020 framework. </p>

<p> Before I conclude, an acknowledgment. There has been a small change
among EACL's student board members. We welcome Ivan Vulic (KU Leuven)
as a new student board member and at the same time we would like to
thank Pierre Lison (Department of Informatics, University of Oslo) for
his involvement in the EACL student board. </p>

<p> Finally, we were deeply saddened to learn about the sudden death of
Emanuele Pianta, Senior Researcher at the Human Language Technology
Group (HLT) of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in Italy. We would
like to express our sincere condolences and sympathies to his family
and colleagues. </p>

<h2> 4. Report on EACL 2014 </h2>

<p> The first call for bids for EACL 2014 was sent out in April 2011, with
a second call in August. We received 3 bids by the October
deadline. The bids were reviewed by the EACL Board, along various
dimensions, including budget, local facilities, and experience and
standing of the proposed local organisation team. All 3 bids were put
through to a second stage, during which the bidders were asked a
series of questions from the EACL Board. The bidders then submitted a
final proposal. At the end of this process, a clear winner emerged,
voted for unanimously by the members of the Board, and this was the
bid from Gothenburg in Sweden. </p>

<p> The preparation for EACL 2014 is running smoothly, with the conference
venue in Gothenburg currently being finalised. We were delighted that
Shuly Wintner agreed to be General Chair, and Shuly has already
assembled an excellent team of conference chairs. The program chairs
will be Sharon Goldwater (Edinburgh) and Stefan Riezler
(Heidelberg). Emanuele Pianta had agreed to be one of the publications
chairs, but, due to his recent sad and untimely death, Shuly had to
search for a replacement. Emanuele's absence is already being felt by
the EACL community. </p>

<h2> 5. Report on EACL 2012 </h2>

<p> The 13th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for
Computational Linguistics took place in Avignon, France, April 23-27,
2012. The General Chair was Walter Daelemans, and Program Co-chairs
were Lluis Marquez and Mirella Lapata. Local arrangements were handled
by a team led by Marc El-Beze. </p>

<p> EACL 2012 received 326 submissions out of which 85 papers were
accepted for presentation (an acceptance rate of 26%). 48 papers
(14.7%) were presented orally, and 34 (10.4%) as posters. The papers
were selected by a program committee of 28 area chairs, from Asia,
Europe, and North America, assisted by a panel of 471 reviewers.  Each
submission was reviewed by three reviewers, who were furthermore
encouraged to discuss any divergences they might have, and the papers
in each area were ranked by the area chairs. The final selection was
made by the program co-chairs after an independent check of all
reviews and discussions with the area chairs. </p>

<p> This year EACL introduced an author response period. Authors were able
to read and respond to the reviews of their paper before the program
committee made a final decision. They were asked to correct factual
errors in the reviews and answer questions raised in the reviewers
comments. The intention was to help produce more accurate
reviews. Another new feature was to allow authors to include optional
supplementary material in addition to the paper itself (e.g., code,
data sets, and resources). Finally, in an attempt to eliminate any
bias from the reviewing process the program co-chairs put in place a
double-blind reviewing system where the identity of the authors was
not revealed to the area chairs. </p>

<p> The best paper was awarded to Franco M. Luque, Ariadna Quattoni, Borja
Balle, and Xavier Carreras for their work on "Spectral Learning for
Non-Deterministic Dependency Parsing". A dedicated committee chaired
by Stephen Clark considered the best paper nominations and made the
final decision. The prize was sponsored by Google. The best paper and
two finalists were presented in plenary sessions at the conference.
The conference had three invited speakers. Martin Cooke spoke about
"Speech Communication in the Wild", Regina Barzilay discussed the
topic of "Learning to Behave by Reading", and Raymond Mooney
presented his work on "Learning Language from Perceptual Context". </p>

<p> In addition to the main conference program, EACL 2012 featured the
Student Research Workshop, 10 workshops, 4 tutorials and a demo
session with 21 presentations. </p>

<p> Overall, EACL 2012 was a great success, amidst Avignon's stunning
surroundings, featuring an exciting scientific program and superb
social activities. </p>

<h2> 6. Report on ACL 2012 </h2>

<p> The 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational
Linguistics took place in Jeju Island, Korea, 8 -- 11th July 2012.
The General Chair was Haizhou Li and the Program Co-Chairs were
Chin-Yew Lin and Miles Osborne. </p>

<p> ACL 50 was delighted to have two keynote speakers, both of whom are
very well known in the language community: Aravind Joshi and Mark
Johnson. They gave coordinated talks addressing the 50th ACL
anniversary: "Remembrance of ACLs past" and "Computational
linguistics: Where do we go from here?". </p>

<p> As is usual, the first day started with tutorials (chaired by Michael
Strube). The main program received 571 valid long paper submissions
and 369 short paper submissions. 19% of the long papers and 20% of the
short papers were accepted. </p>

<p> Twenty nine Area Chairs worked with 665 reviewers, producing 1830 long
paper reviews and 1187 short paper reviews. Everything ran to a tight
schedule and there were no slippages. This would not have been
possible without our wonderful and diligent Area Chairs and
Reviewers. Thanks! </p>

<p> Of the many papers, two were selected as being outstanding: "Bayesian
Symbol-Refined Tree Substitution Grammars for Syntactic Parsing" by
Hiroyuki Shindo, Yusuke Miyao, Akinori Fujino, Masaaki Nagata and
"String Re-writing Kernel" by Fan Bu, Hang Li, Xiaoyan Zhu. </p>

<p> Our Demo Chair, Min Zhang, started a novel review process and selected
29 quality system demos. The Faculty Advisors, Kentaro Inui, Greg
Kondrak, and Yang Liu, and Student Chairs, Jackie Cheung, Jun Hatori,
Carlos Henriquez and Ann Irvine, assembled an excellent program for
the Student Research Workshop with 12 accepted papers. The Mentoring
Chair, Joyce Chai, coordinated the mentorship of 13 papers. The
Publicity Chairs, Jung-jae Kim and Youngjoong Ko, developed the
website, newsletters, and conference handbook that kept us updated all
the time. Exhibition Chair, Byeongchang Kim, coordinated more than 10
exhibitors with a strong industry presence. </p>

<p> The lifetime achievement award went to Charles Fillmore. </p>

<p> After the main conference there were two days of workshops (chaired by
Massimo Poesio and Satoshi Sekine), plus 3 days of the EMNLP-CoNLL
conference. </p>

<h2> 7. Report on NAACL 2012 </h2>

<p> NAACL HLT 2012 took place June 3-8, 2012 in Montreal. The conference
completed successfully, attracting a healthy number of attendees. The
organizing committee was excellent and put together interesting
programs and I am very grateful for the effort they put into this
conference. </p>

<p> The main conference received 196 full paper submissions of which 61
papers were accepted (31% acceptance rate), as well as 105 short paper
submissions of which 36 were accepted (34% acceptance). The number of
submissions received was lower than in past years, and, based on
postmortem analysis, is likely due to the fact that the submission
deadline was 9 days before the ACL submission deadline and that no
double submissions were permitted. </p>

<p> This year we also inaugurated "NLP Idol", a "game show" in which four
contestants each tried to convince the audience that a past paper
deserves a revisit in today's NLP world. The contestants and judges
all did a great job, and it was both informative and entertaining for
all involved. Overall, this new session was very well received. </p>

<h2> 8. Report on EMNLP-CoNLL 2012 </h2>

<p> 2012 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language
Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning July 12-14,
2012 Jeju Island, Korea </p>

<p> This year the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language
Learning (EMNLP) and the Conference on Computational Natural Language
Learning (CoNLL) were held jointly, and jointly organised by their
respective special interest groups, SIGDAT and SIGNLL. EMNLP-CoNLL
2012 was co-located with ACL's 50th anniversary conference, on the
beautiful Jeju Island in South Korea. </p>

<p> In addition to the focus on data-driven methods that is common to the
SIGDAT and SIGNLL communities, this year's program included the CoNLL
tradition of a shared task.  Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti and
Nianwen Xue organised a shared task on "Modeling Multilingual
Unrestricted Coreference in OntoNotes".  We were also lucky to have
two excellent invited speakers, Eric Xing and Patrick Pantel,
representing the combination of theoretical insight and practical
relevance that has given both EMNLP and CoNLL such a high impact in
the ACL community. </p>

<p> Out of 606 submissions received by EMNLP-CoNLL this year, a total of
36 submissions were eventually withdrawn or rejected without
review. From the remaining submissions, 99 were accepted for oral
presentation and 40 for poster presentation, for a combined acceptance
rate of 24.8%. Acceptance decisions drew on the expertise of a team of
525 primary and 66 secondary reviewers, 22 area chairs, and 2 program
chairs. Authors of accepted submissions were offered an additional
page in the camera-ready paper so that they could better address the
comments received from reviewers. 335 people registered to attend
EMNLP-CoNLL 2012. </p>

<p> Organising such a large conference requires a lot of work from many
people. Special thanks should go to the general chair, Jun'ichi
Tsujii, and the publications chair, Naoaki Okazaki.  We benefited
enormously from the local organisation provided by ACL, in particular
Gary Geunbae Lee, but also Michael White, Maggie Li and Jong Park.
Many people provided helpful advice, including David Yarowsky, Paola
Merlo, Naoh Smith, Xavier Carreras and Priscilla Rasmussen. </p>

<h2> 9. Report on ESSLLI 2012  </h2>

<p> The European Summer Schools in Logic, Language and Information
(ESSLLI) have been organised every year since 1989 under the auspices
of the Association for Logic, Language and Information (FoLLI) in
different cities around Europe. The ESSLLI series has established
itself as one of the major annual academic events in Europe, where
dozens of worldwide leading academics present courses, organise
workshops, and exchange ideas on a wide variety of established and new
topics in the areas of Logic, Language, and Computation. It is
regularly attended by several hundreds of highly motivated master and
doctoral students and young researchers. One of the most distinct and
valuable features of the ESSLLI schools is their highly
interdisciplinary nature, making them a unique meeting point of
logicians, linguists, computer scientists, philosophers, and
mathematicians. </p>

<p> The 24th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
(ESSLLI 2012, <a href="http://www.esslli2012.pl">http://www.esslli2012.pl</a>) 
took place at the University
of Opole, Poland, during August 6-17, 2012. The organisation committee
was chaired by Janusz Czelakowski and Urszula Wybraniec-Skardowska
(Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Opole) and
the programme committee was chaired by Andreas Herzig (University of
Toulouse and CNRS). During two weeks, over 350 participants were
offered a rich academic program of their choice from 9 foundational,
16 introductory and 17 advanced courses and 6 workshops. Just as in
the previous years, the 17th conference on Formal Grammar colocated
with ESSLLI. </p>

<p> Besides the regular courses, a traditional highlight of the summer
school were the 4 evening lectures by distinguished academics:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Johan van Benthem (Institute for Logic, Language &amp; Computation
(ILLC), Amsterdam and Department of Philosophy, Stanford University),
``Computation as Agency'';

<li>Melvin Fitting (Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, City
University of New York), ``Reasoning About Games'';

<li>Jonathan Ginzburg (UFR Etudes anglophones, Universite Paris-Diderot
(Paris 7)), ``False starts, jokes, and music: semantics in the 21st
century'';

<li>Adam Przepiorkowski (Institute of Computer Science, Polish Academy
of Sciences, Warsaw), ``Secret life of corpora''.
</ul>

<p> Another traditional event was the student session, organised by a
student programme committee chaired by Rasmus K. Rendsvig (University
of Copenhagen): master and doctoral students presented 16 papers and 5
posters, and Michal Zawidzki obtained the best paper award and Raul
Fervari obtained the best poster award. Moreover, the Beth
Dissertation Prizes were announced at the FoLLI General Meeting and
went to Andreas Kapsner (University of Barcelona) and Daniel R. Licata
(Carnegie Mellon University). </p>

<p> Apart from the busy academic programme, participants of the summer
school were offered an exciting social program as well. In addition to
the traditional ESSLLI Party and the famous Students vs. Lecturers
Soccer Match (also called `Johan van Benthem Cup'), kayaking, and
excursions to Krakow and Wroclaw were offered. </p>

<p> The budget of ESSLLI 2012 was based mainly on the participants'
registration fees, with additional funding from the national research
agency, local and international cultural institutions and academic
organizations and business. In line with the ESSLLI tradition, all
teaching and organizing work for the summer school was done on a
voluntary basis. Lecturers and workshop organizers were not paid for
their contribution but were reimbursed for part of their travel and
accommodation cost. This made it possible to keep the participation at
the school affordable for graduate students and to award several
grants to underprivileged but highly motivated students who would have
otherwise been unable to attend the summer school. </p>

<p> To sum it up, ESSLLI 2012 was a very successful and memorable academic
and cultural event, and since its closing day many of the participants
began looking forward to the next edition: ESSLLI 2013 in Dusseldorf,
Germany, August 5-16, 2013. Chair of the Program Committee is Johan
Bos (University of Groningen, The Netherlands), and Chair of the
Organizing Committee is Wiebke Petersen (University of Dusseldorf). </p>
