    <h2>1. Editorial</h2>
    
    After 4 years of service, Donia Scott will soon be stepping down from
    her office as EACL chair. During those four years, Donia has done an
    incredible job in revitalising EACL. Indeed, it is under her term that
    the EACL community witnessed the creation of a student board which
    allows junior researchers to learn and participate in the organisation
    of major CL events; the launch of a newsletter which (I hope)
    creates a better understanding of the aims and activities of the EACL
    and ACL related organisations; the revamping of the EACL web site for
    better communication and most of all, the broadening of the EACL
    conference with a new "Research notes" session!
    
    <p>
      
      These achievements are just the tip of the iceberg, the visible
      part. The invisible part as I have witnessed it, is hours of hard work
      and volumes of patience, strength and human understanding. Thank you,
      Donia, for doing such an outstanding job! We look forward to thanking
      you in person in Budapest next Spring.

    <h2>2. Some Views From The Chair</h2>
    
    This is my last communication with you as Chair, as my term expires in
    December.  The Nominating Committee has proposed a new Board and, in
    accordance with our constitution, this is being circulated to all
    EACL members for ratification. The proposed board for 2002-2004 is:
    
    <p>

    <table cellspacing="10" cellpadding="5">
      <tr>
	<td>Secretary</td>
	<td>John Carroll (UK)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>Treasurer</td>
	<td>Mike Rosner (Mt)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>Chair-elect</td>
	<td>Gertjan Van Noord (NL)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td>Advisory Board</td>
	<td>Felisa Verdejo (E)<br>
	  Galia Angelova (Bg)<br>
	  Hans Uszkoreit (D)<br>
	  Ido Dagan (Isr)<br></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      As the current Chair-elect, Claire Gardent will automatically assume the
      role of Chair.

    <p>
      Any additional nominations must be sent to the EACL Secretary by
      email (<a
      href="mailto:secretary@eacl.org">secretary@eacl.org</a>) by 15
      October 2002: each nomination must be supported by at least
      three Chapter members and evidence must be presented that the
      nominee will serve if elected. If there are further nominations
      there will be a ballot of Chapter members; otherwise, the
      proposed slate will stand.

    <p>
      I would like to take this opportunity to thank those members of the
      Board who will be officially standing down: Philippe Blache, Tomaz
      Erjavec and Piek Vossen.  I say "officially" since they will generously
      continue to support the EACL community beyond their term of office:
      Philippe and Piek will be continuing their involvement in the
      organisation of the the EACL'03 conference, particularly in the
      solicitation of commercial and government sponsorship for the
      conference, and Tomaz's catalogue of upcoming events of relevance to the
      CL community will continue to be disseminated  via the EACL web-site.
      Thanks also to Kemal Oflazer and Walter Daelemans, who will be stepping
      down from the Nominating Committee.

    <p>
      Finally, I would like to thank you all for the opportunity to work with
      you (twice!) in my capacity as Chair.  I look forward to thanking you
      all in person in Budapest next Spring.

<h2>3. EACL News: More on the new EACL WEB site</h2>

    In the last newsletter we announced the redesign of the EACL
    website and a preview of the new look-and-feel. The new site is
    now online at <a
    href="http://www.eacl.org">http://www.eacl.org</a>. There you will
    find a wealth of information about the organisation, a calendar of
    European and Worldwide conferences and workshops, downloadable
    membership forms and contact details for the board.

<p>
      In addition there are two resource sections, one containing
      links for the CL/NLP community as a whole, and one dedicated to
      students in the field. We hope that with your help we can build
      this into a comprehensive guide to online materials. We welcome
      additions and corrections to these links, and would like to use
      this opportunity to ask you to send in your favourite five or
      ten URLs for inclusion on the resource pages. An online form has
      been set up to make this easy (all you need do is cut and paste
      the links into the form and click submit) and can be accessed
      via the "Give us your Feedback" link on every page of the site,
      or directly through this link: <a
      href="http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/eacl/email.php3">http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/eacl/email.php3</a>.

    <p>
      The student board are also responsible for the Student Research
      Workshop (SRW) to be held next April at EACL'03 in Budapest. A
      preliminary call for papers has already been sent out and
      further information is available on the workshop website at <a
      href="http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/conf/eacl03-student/">http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/conf/eacl03-student/</a>. The
      student session will broadly follow the format of recent ACL
      SRWs, being held within the main conference programme and with
      session panellists specially selected for each accepted paper.

    <p>
      The student board can be contacted on <a href="mailto:students@eacl.org">students@eacl.org</a>

    <h2>4. National CL/NLP Conferences: CLUK: Computational Linguistics UK</h2>

    CLUK is a broad-based organisation for computational linguists and NLP
    researchers in the UK. It aims to complement the activities of European
    and international professional organisations (e.g. EACL/ACL) by
    providing:
    
    <ul>
      <li>a forum for communication between CL researchers in the UK
      <li>a focus for feedback from the UK CL community on national
      funding issues
      <li>a structure for bringing together and supporting UK research students
    </ul>

    CLUK is organised very informally, with a committee of a dozen or
    so research students and more established researchers and without
    any executive posts or permanent budget. CLUK has a website <a
    href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/research/cluk/">http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/research/cluk/</a>
    containing a database of UK CL researchers (around 100 listed) and
    sets of links to online resources and information; it maintains a
    mailing list (visit the website for details about how to subscribe
    and send a mail to the list); it also organises colloquia,
    traditionally held at the beginning of January each year.

    <p>
      The colloquia are mainly targetted towards students, giving them a
      supportive environment in which they can start to present their work,
      make contacts, and discuss ongoing work with their peers from other
      institutions. The colloquia consist of student talks and posters, with a
      couple of invited talks from well-known CL researchers. The most recent
      (5th) CLUK Colloquium was hosted by the University of Leeds, and the
      next will be held at the University of Edinburgh, January 6-7, 2003.
      Students, watch out for the call for papers in the autumn!

    <h2>5. EACL sponsored Events</h2>

    <h3>ESSLLI'02, Trento</h3>

    There was an EACL-sponsored course in 'Shallow Text Processing',
    lectured by Chris Brew of the Ohio State University, as part of the
    14th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information, 5-16
    August 2002, Trento Italy. The course was Foundational, so the brief
    was to make the material accessible to students from a wide range of
    backgrounds.  The goal was to provide people inexperienced in
    statistical and data-driven NLP with a taste of the capabilities of
    current text processing technology, and to get across some of the key
    concepts in building task-specific and data-driven systems.  As is
    perhaps inevitable, some of the students had substantial prior
    knowledge of machine learning and text processing, while others were
    experiencing the area for the first time. The topics and level were
    chosen to appeal to the latter group.

    <p>
      Text is the native encoding standard for much commercially and
      scientifically significant information. Even in highly structured
      databases, such as occur in bioinformatics, law and medicine, it
      is usually the case that explicitly structured information (such as
      database rows) is complemented by free text. We therefore need to
      find ways of processing such text. 

    <p>
      Many text problems have properties that favor the use of 
      data-driven methods. 

    <ul>
      <li>They require processing of unrestricted text. 
      <li>The domain of the texts to be processed is known.  
      <li>The whole system is intended to produce a particular, well-defined
	output
      <li>Examples of the desired output exist or are easy to create.
    </ul>

    Examples include

    <ul>
      <li>Find and summarise job adverts mined from the Internet
      <li>Assemble summaries of terrorist activities
      <li>Domain specific text-to-speech systems
      <li>Standardising bibliographic citations
    </ul>

    In a foundational course some preliminaries are necessary.  The
    introductory part of the course covered n-gram based Language
    Identification, followed by a quick introduction decision trees. This
    part was designed to introduce the notion of sparse data and the
    crucial technique of cross-validation. Later in the course the
    examples were coreference classification (Aone and Bennett's MLR, and
    McCarthy and Lehnert's RESOLVE) and extraction from job adverts
    (Califf and Mooney's RAPIER). The point of these examples were, on the
    one hand, to emphasise the crucial importance of good task analysis to
    Shallow Text Processing, and on the other hand to give a taste of the
    variety of techniques currently used. At the very end I indulged in
    some guesses about the future, suggesting that it may be useful to
    think of Shallow Text Processing not so much as an approximation to
    the hard task of Deep Text Processing but as a separate discipline in
    which system design is motivated by a combination of novel or adapted
    machine learning techniques, task analysis and careful thought about
    document structure and author intent.

    <p>
      ESSLLI was as usual diverse and busy, Trento was beautiful, the local
      organization was energetic and effective, and part of the pleasure was
      seeing the vitality of the many linguistic and logical topics that are
      neither fashionable in the U.S. nor primarily motivated by engineering
      concerns. But Shallow Text Processing remains an important topic, and
      one which provides a likely channel for the creativity of people
      looking to use their linguistic, logical and computational skills to
      produce systems that obtain, process and use information extracted
      from text. If that happens, and the designers are ESSLLI alumni, I bet
      they'll produce things that are not only technically effective but
      also linguistically sophisticated and of theoretical interest.
      Finally, I'd like to thank the students for their interest and
      provocative questioning, and EACL for its encouragement and
      financial support.

    <h2>6. Future Events: EACL03, Budapest (<a href="http://www.conferences.hu/EACL03/">http://www.conferences.hu/EACL03/</a>)</h2>

    As anounced in the previous EACL newsletter, the next EACL conference
    will be held in Budapest, Hungary on April 12-17, 2003. As has now
    become usual, the main program will be completed by a student
    workshop, thematic workshops, tutorials and software demos. However,
    the conference will also include two new features.

    <p>
      First, a call for research notes has been issued which invites short,
      4 pages contributions presenting work in progress, project status
      reports, unevaluated results or system summaries. Accepted research
      notes will be presented at the main conference (during special
      sessions reserved to that effect) and published in a companion volume
      to the conference proceedings. Like the main program papers, research
      notes submission will be reviewed by an international scientific
      committee. Selection criteria will be less stringent however.

    <p>
      The intention behind this new feature is to open the conference to a
      wider community by including not only the traditional high-quality
      (i.e., low acceptance rate) theoretical track, but also a more applied
      track of "demo-talks" and a session for work-in-progress reports from
      national and pan-European projects. In this way, we hope to make the
      EACL conference an important meeting place and forum for discussion
      for students and researchers interested in computational linguistics
      and natural language processing.

    <p>
      The second new feature is a "Europe specific thematic orientation"
      whereby the various calls each encourage submissions (i.e., papers,
      research notes, demos, workshop or tutorials) on tools and resources
      for less-studied European and African/Mediterranean languages. Again
      this is meant to open the door more widely to the local CL community
      and to highlight the specificity of the European Chapter conference.
      Or in Donia Scott's words in the previous newsletter to make "EACL
      conferences become a gathering of all European CL researchers and a
      showcase for the extensive activities in our field within Europe; (to
      make it) a conference that is `complementary to' rather than
      `competitive with' the annual ACL meetings."

<h2>7. European Gossip</h2>

<h3>Beth Prize for outstanding dissertations in Logic, Language and
   Information</h3>

    The European Association for Logic, Language and Information (FoLLI)
    awards an annual prize to oustanding dissertations in the fields of
    Logic, Language and Information.  The first competition of the FoLLI
    Dissertation Prize was held in the spring of 1998. Since 2002, the
    E. W. Beth Foundation kindly sponsors the prize which has therefore
    been named as the E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize in honour of the Dutch
    logician and philosopher Ewert Willem Beth (1908-1964).

    <p>
      An international committee selected the winners for the years 2001 and
      2002 from a list of of truly outstanding nominations. On August 8, the
      prizes for the two years were awarded in a special ceremony at the
      European Summer School of Logic, Language and Information in
      Trento. The 2001 prize went to Gerald Penn of the University of
      Toronto for his dissertation `The Algebraic Structure of Attributed
      Type Signatures`. In this thesis Penn designs an algebraic foundation
      of typed feature structures that has led to a new algorithmic basis
      and an efficient implemented system for grammatical processing.  The
      Beth Prize 2002 has been awarded to Maria Aloni of the University of
      Amsterdam for her thesis `Quantification under Conceptual Covers` in
      which she works out a new treatment of quantification in dynamic
      logic. In contrast to earlier notions of quantification in dynamic
      logic Aloni's solution does not suffer from undesirable over- or
      underspecification.
