<h2>EDITORIAL</h2>
<p>
Welcome to the Autumn edition of the EACL newsletter.  EACL is busy
preparing for the meeting in Trento in 2006.  On that score, students
should read this edition's article on EACL sponsorship---it may be to
your financial advantage!  The article also describes the kinds of
things we have sponsored, what we would like to sponsor, and how to
apply for money.
</p>
<p>
EACL has two new members on the student board, and Sebastian Pado
continues on the board for another year.  With all these
changes, we have taken this newsletter as an opportunity to
introduce all three of them to you.
</p>
<p>
As always, this year's conference season was extremely busy; indeed,
looking at the list of events in the calendar at the end of this
newsletter (thanks to Sebastian Pado for providing this), the
conference season is far from over!  Please read Chris
Callison-Burch's article describing his personal views of ACL 2005,
Shuly Wintner's report on ISCOL 2005, a report on the summer school
EUROLAN 2005, written by the organizing committee, and a report on the
most recent PASCAL workshop written Ido Dagan; this also gives details
of the future NLP challenges to be addressed by PASCAL.
</p>
<p>
The computational linguistics community in Europe is currently in
an extremely vibrant state, with the launch of several new
orgnanisations, research groups and pan-European education
programmes.  Some of the new initiatives are described here.
Shuly has kindly supplied the newsletter with information about the
(relatively) new SIG in Semitic Languages.  Everyone is encouraged to
get involved in this exciting new area of computational linguistics!
Plans are also now underway to form a new organisation called the
Nordic-Baltic Assocation of Language Technology.  Find out about it in
Kimmo Koskenniemi's article.  On the education front, we have a new
integrated European masters programme in language and communication
(LCT), and Mike Rosner and Valia Kordoni give details here.  I have
also included an announcement of the EACL policy for supporting
educational programmes in Europe; a policy on which we settled at the
EACL executive committee meeting that took place in June.
</p>
<p>
I hope you enjoy this edition of the newsletter.  I am extremely
grateful to everyone that has contributed to this issue.  And I look
forward to seeing you in Trento in April.

<h2>A Reminder About EACL Sponsorships</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Scale</b>: Each year, the EACL may make available a limited number of
sponsorships, each worth a relatively small amount of
money. Sponsorships are awarded only if the EACL budget allows
it. <br>
In 2004, EACL sponsored two students to attend ESSLLI (Nancy, France),
for approx. 800 Euros each.

<li>
<b>Focus</b>: In awarding sponsorships, EACL focuses on education in
computational linguistics in the geographical area of the
EACL. Priority is given to students from Eastern Europe and more
generally, to students from countries with hard currency problems
(within the geographical area covered by EACL).
<br>
In the past, EACL has sponsored introductory courses at European
summer-schools (in the form of a contribution towards the presenters'
expenses), participation at summer-schools (funding tuition fees and
subsistence expenses for students who would otherwise not have been
able to come) and participation at student workshops at EACL
conferences (contribution towards student-presenters' expenses).
<li>
<b>Visibility</b>: In return for sponsorship, EACL expects some visibility
(for instance, the sponsorship is announced in a workshop programme,
website etc.).  A request for sponsorship must include a
description of the visibility for EACL generated by the sponsorship.
<li>
<b>How to Apply</b>:
A request for sponsorship should identify a concrete purpose. Indeed,
EACL will not sponsor a school or workshop in general, but it will
sponsor a particular course, tutorial, etc., or it will sponsor
participation for a particular group of students etc.
<br>
To prepare a request for sponsorship please consult and follow the
instructions on the EACL pages for sponsorship at <tt>http://www.eacl.org</tt>
(or <tt>http://eacl.coli.uni-saarland.de/Sponsorship.php</tt>).
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <b>Student Sponsorhips in 2005</b>:
In 2005, EACL finances allowed us to be more generous than in the
years before. We sponsored the ESSLLI 2005 Summer School in Edinburgh
with 3000 Euros. Out of this fund, the ESSLLI supported four students
from Eastern European countries.
<li><b>Student Sponsorships in 2006</b>:
For the upcoming EACL 2006 conference in Trento, the EACL will provide
financial support for a limited number of students. The terms and
procedures for sponsorship requests will be announced at the EACL 2006
web site in due time.

<h2>THE STUDENT BOARD</h2>
<p>
EACL's student board now consists of Sebastian Pado, Violeta Seretan
and Jonathon Read:
</p>
<h3>SEBASTIAN PADO</h3>
<p>
I am a PhD student at Saarland University in Saarbruecken, Germany,
and involved in the SALSA project, the goal of which is to annotate
and analyse German corpora with role-semantic information. The topic
of my thesis is cross-lingual projection of semantic information, with
the view of re-using role-semantic resources existing for English
(e.g. FrameNet) for other languages. </p>

<p>
Before embarking on my PhD, I received an M.Sc. in Cognitive Science
and Natural Language from Edinburgh University for a thesis on
dependency-based semantic space models.
</p>

<h3>VIOLETTA SERETAN</h3>
<p>
I am a Ph.D. student in Computational Linguistics at the Language
Technology Laboratory (LATL), University of Geneva (Switzerland).  At
LATL, I have been involved in a project of multilingual lexical
acquisition, and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. under the
supervision of Eric Wehrli. My research focuses on a subclass of
multi-word expressions particularly important in text production
applications: collocations. Since linguistic information is seen as a
useful complement to statistical methods in the computational
treatment of collocations, I am using state-of-the-art natural
language technology for collocation processing, with the final goal of
compiling linguistically-rich collocation resources for translation
and generation.  I am also a Teaching Assistant in NLP and Databases
undergraduate courses. </p>
<p>
Before LATL, I earned a M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of
Iasi (Romania) with a thesis on the relation between discourse
structure and anaphora supervised by Dan Cristea.
</p>
<h3>JONATHON READ:</h3>
<p>
I have completed one year of a doctoral programme in the
Natural Language and Computational Linguistics research group,
supervised by John Carroll, at the University of Sussex.  My research
will investigate both supervised and unsupervised methods for
classifying documents according to authors' general sentiment, be it
positive, negative or neutral.  Automatic analysis of
sentiment-bearing language is an important milestone in the
development of affective computing -- technology that recognises and
responds to the emotional state of its users.  My homepage is at:

<h2>REPORT ON ACL 2005</h2>
<p>
This year's ACL had a huge attendance.  There were over 700 registered
participants (a new record), and included significantly increased
student participation.  The whole of the conference ran with multiple
concurrent sessions with the exception of three plenary sessions,
which were the invited talks by Justine Cassell and Michael Jordan,
and the presentation of the lifetime achievement award to Martin Kay.
Martin's acceptance speech was notable not only because it was
genuinely charming and humorous, but also because he made an important
distinction between "computational linguistics" (the use of computers
to investigate and further linguistic theory) and "natural language
processing" (engineering advancements for text processing
applications), and hinted that we had strayed too far from our
computational linguistic roots.  On the whole, I think that the
conference could have benefitted from an increased number of plenary
sessions to bring everyone together.  As it was, I managed to attend
machine translation talks almost to the exclusion of other topics.
There were some excellent talks in the MT sessions, including David
Chiang's presentation on his advancements to phrase-based models of MT
(for which he won the best paper award), and Franz Och's invited
presentation at the MT workshop where he made the memorable analogies
of machine translation being like going to the moon, and Google being
like NASA.  All in all it was a great conference with excellent
organization at the site, and with enough substance for many more days
than it spanned.

<h2>ISCOL 2005</h2>
<p>
ISCOL-2005, the Israeli Seminar on Computational Linguistics, took  
place on June 22, 2005 at the  Technion, Haifa. This year's meeting  
was held in conjunction with the 21st annual meeting of the Israel  
Association for Theoretical Linguistics. It featured an invited talk  
by Khalil Sima'an (ILLC, Amsterdam University), a special session on  
morphological analysis and disambiguation of Semitic languages, six  
contributed presentations and a panel on "cooperation between  
theoretical and computational linguists in research and technology".  
More than 60 participants attended. See more details at: <tt>http://

<h2>EUROLAN 2005</h2>
<p>
The Seventh biennial EUROLAN International Summer School
(<tt>http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/eurolan2005/</tt>) was held in Cluj-Napoca,
Romania, from July 25 to August 5, 2005. This year's edition was
masterminded by the two traditional organizers, the Faculty of
Computer Science at Cuza University and the Research Institute for
Artificial Intelligence at the Romanian Academy in Bucharest, this
time working in a close cooperation also with the University
Babe-Bolyai of Cluj-Napoca, which also hosted the event. The school
was among the most successful in its 12-years history, with 75
registered participants from 13 countries.
</p>
<p>
It is in the tradition of the EUROLAN summer schools to orientate its
themes around topics which have gained a lot of recent attention
within the research community. This summer school provided two weeks
of intensive study focussing on multilingual processing, and in
particular applications involving multilingual access to the web.
International known scholars served as professors and trainers at the
school, giving seminars and hands-on labs. These included Branimir
Boguraev, Alexandru Ceausu, Dan Cristea, Hamish Cunningham, Dieter
Fensel, Nancy Ide, Radu Ion, Martin Kay, Bernardo Magnini, Daniel
Marcu, Rada Mihalcea, Ruslan Mitkov, Vivi Nastase, Nicolas Nicolov,
Constantin Orasan, Marius Pasca, Ted Pederson, Emanuele Pianta, Oana
Postolache, Georgiana Puscasu, Dumitru Roman, Dan Stefanescu, Valentin
Tablan, Ioan Toma, Dan Tufis, Cristi Ursu. There were also several
workshops and a poster session.  The dense scientific program was
offset with a number of social events, including a city tour and
excursion to transilvania, among others.
</p>
<p>
The organisers gratefully acknowledge the sponsorship of: Knowledge
Web Network of Excellence, IJCAI, Siemens Program and System
Engineering Romania, Vassar College, Technord Belgium, Google Inc.,
Language Weaver, Microsoft Romania, Siemens VDO Romania, the Romanian
Ministry of Education and Research, DERI Austria, University of
Sheffield, the Romanian Bank of Development and the Italo-Romanian

<h2>PASCAL Workshop and Challenges</h2>
<p>
The first PASCAL Challenges Workshop, of the PASCAL Network of
Excellence on Pattern Analysis, Statistical Modeling and Computational
Learning, was held in Southampton, England, April 11-13. This event
addressed four PASCAL challenges, including two within the CL/NLP
area: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Recognising Textual Entailment, and 
  <li>Evaluating Machine Learning for Information Extraction
</ul>
<p>
The textual entailment challenge provided the first benchmark
for this recently proposed empirical task. The challenge was met with
a significant response, attracting 17 submissions worldwide, about
half of them from Europe. 13 groups presented their work in a one day
workshop. The works demonstrated a wide range of approaches at the
lexical, syntactic, semantic and logical levels, involving various
empirical techniques. Short system reports were published in the
workshop proceedings (available from
<tt>http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE/</tt>), while longer
version papers will be published in a Springer Lecture Notes in the AI
collection. A second round of the challenge is planned for the coming
year (see below), and the release of the development set for this is
expected during October, with the release of the test set in January.
</p>
<p>
The half day Information Extraction workshop included presentations
from six participating groups. The challenge included several tasks
that addressed alternative supervision modes and knowledge sources 
to extract information fields from conference announcements. 
Participating systems explored issues such as selective sampling, 
feature selection and utilizing various machine learning techniques.
</p>
<p>
Two additional PASCAL challenges in the NLP area are the Evaluating
Ontology Learning and Population Challenge, and the new Letter-to-Sound
Conversion Challenge. The next PASCAL Challenges Workshop will be held
in Venice, April 10-12, 2006.
</p>

<h2>SIG IN SEMITIC LANGUAGES</h2>

<p>
On May 15, 2005, the ACL Executive Committee approved a
proposal to form a Special Interest Group (SIG) on Computational  
Approaches to Semitic Languages. The SIG was inaugurated during the  
ACL-2005 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Semitic Languages,  
held in Ann Arbor, MI on June 29th, 2005.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of the SIG is to bring together researchers and  
practitioners who are interested in computational approaches to  
Semitic languages, emphasizing the common challenges and solutions  
rather than the distinctive features of this family of languages. The  
SIG will encourage exchange of ideas, sharing of resources, promotion  
of interest in computational approaches to Semitic languages and  
organization of conferences and workshops dedicated to this area,  
guaranteeing at least one biennial meeting.
</p>
<p>
Membership in the SIG is open for all and free. Elections for SIG  
officers are currently underway. We are seeking nominations for the  
offices of Chair, Secretary and Information Officers. See 
<tt>http://www.semitic.tk/</tt> for more details.

<h2>ESTABLISHING THE NORDIC-BALTIC ASSOCATION OF LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>
There has been a long-standing and intensive cooperation in language
technology among Nordic countries for decades: bi-annual NODALIDA
conferences since 1970s, researcher courses since 1992, a NODALI
mailing list, a Nordic research program 2000-2005, a Nordic Graduate
School of Language Technology (NGSLT) 2004-2008, and so on.  In
addition, there has been much discussion over recent years to
establish a formal association for the region.  In May 2005, at the
NODALIDA 2005 conference in Joensuu Finland, we unanimously decided to
go ahead and found such an association.
</p>
<p>
A small preparatory working group consisting of Kimmo Koskenniemi
(Helsinki), Joakim Nivre (Växjö, Sweden) and Janne Bondi Johannessen
(Oslo) was nominated to prepare a constitution for the association,
and specifically study how the new association should relate itself to
existing organizations such as ACL and EACL.
</p>
<p>
An association for the Nordic-Baltic area was considered useful as it
would provide continuity with the four-year Nordic Languge Technology
Program, which ended in 2004.  An association would be a useful
framework for a number of activities, such as running an electronic
journal, collecting the history of Nordic language technology,
advancing various initiatives, and supporting existing activities such
as the NODALIDA conference meetings.
</p>

<h2>EACL POLICY ON SUPPORT FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMES</h2>

<p>
EACL, as an official organization representing computational
linguistics (CL) in Europe, encourages the general development of
educational programs for CL that promote the field and encourage its
diffusion throughout Europe. In particular, EACL encourages programmes
that operate at a multi-national level, such as exchange support
programs for students and faculty.
</p>
<p>
However, EACL does not have the capacity to evaluate any specific CL
educational programme, and thus cannot provide official approval or
accreditation for such programmes. Accordingly, general support for
specific programmes can only be granted in such a way that it cannot
be used in a competitive way relative to other comparable activities.
</p>
<p>
The above policy will be manifest at the EACL web site, which will aim
to display links to all multinational European CL educational
programs. A link to this list will be included in letters of support
for specific requests, stating explicitly the scope of the EACL
support policy. In addition, we will keep links to national and
institutional CL programs in a separate space.
</p>
<p>
We solicit submission of website links to all European educational
programs in CL, at the multi-national, national and institutional
levels. Links should be sent by email to: <tt>webmaster@eacl.org</tt>
</p>

<h2>INTEGRATED EUROPEAN MASTERS PROGRAMME IN LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION
TECHNOLOGIES (LCT)</h2>
<p>
A consortium of 10 European Universities (Saarbruecken, Bolzano,
Prague, Malta, Copenhagen Business School, Roskilde, Utrecht,
Amsterdam, Nancy 1 and Nancy 2) have been preparing an integrated
European Masters programme in Language Communication and Technologies
(LCT). A common curriculum has been agreed which follows the Bologna
model for higher education in Europe and comprises 120 ECTS credits,
30 of which make up the Masters dissertation, and 90 of which are
coursework credits made up of compulsory modules in Computer Science
(28 ECTS) and Language Technology (28 ECTS), and advanced modules (34
ECTS) in these and related areas. The exact implementation of modules
is left up to the individual Universities, allowing for limited
variation exploiting the special strengths of each
institution. Coursework is distributed over three semesters, while the
dissertation is completed in the fourth semester. Students will get
the chance to attend the two-year programme at two universities chosen
from the consortium, spending about half the time at each. Those
completing the course will obtain a legally valid Masters degree from
each of the two institutions attended.
</p>
<p>
Funding for the course has been applied for under the EU Erasmus
Mundus programme which aims to enhance quality in European higher
education and to promote intercultural understanding through
co-operation with non-EU countries.
