The European Chapter of the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/">ACL</a> (EACL) is the primary professional association for computational linguistics in Europe. It provides a number of services to its members and the community:

<ul>
     <li/> Continuing its mission of expanding and involving the science community of all European countries, EACL had selected the Ukrainian community for the 16th EACL, which took place online due to the COVID pandemic. Unfortunately, the ongoing war made the organisation in Kyiv impossible. Considering the importance of physical interaction among researchers, especially after the restrictions imposed by the COVID pandemic, in addition to an online mode, <a href="https://2023.eacl.org">the conference will be held in Dubrovnik, Croatia, from 2 to 6 of May, 2023</a>. The original aim of strengthening the connection with the Ukrainian community will not change as our program will feature a dedicated session and a workshop to highlight work on Ukrainian language technologies. As the flagship European conference in the field of computational linguistics, EACL welcomes European and international researchers covering a broad spectrum of research areas that are concerned with computational approaches to natural language.
     <li/> Support for educational initiatives in the field -- for example, EACL-sponsored courses at ESSLLI summer  schools and student grants for selected Computational Linguistics events.
