<p>EACL, as an official organization representing computational
linguistics (CL) in Europe, encourages the general development of
educational programs for CL that promote the field and encourage its
diffusion throughout Europe. In particular, EACL encourages programmes
that operate at a multi-national level, such as exchange support
programs for students and faculty.</p>

<p>However, EACL does not have the capacity to evaluate any specific CL
educational programme, and thus cannot provide official approval or
accreditation for such programmes. Accordingly, general support for
specific programmes can only be granted in such a way that it cannot
be used in a competitive way relative to other comparable activities.</p>
