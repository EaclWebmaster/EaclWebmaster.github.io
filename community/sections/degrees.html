<p>A consortium of 7 European universities (Saarland University, University of Trento, Charles University, University of Malta, University of Lorraine, University of Groningen, University of the Basque Country) offer an integrated European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (LCT).</p>

<p>The joint curriculum follows the Bologna model for higher education in Europe and comprises 120 ECTS credits, 30 of which make up the Masters dissertation, and 90 of which are coursework credits made up of compulsory modules in Computer Science (at least 24 ECTS) and Language Technology (at least 24 ECTS), and advanced modules  in these and related areas. The exact implementation of modules at the individual universities allows for limited variation exploiting the special strengths of each institution.</p>

<p>Coursework is distributed over three semesters, while the dissertation is completed in the fourth semester.</p>

<p>Students attend the two-year program at two European universities chosen from the consortium, typically spending one year at each. They can optionally complete a stay at one of the non-European partners. Graduates of the course obtain two Masters degrees from each of the two institutions attended and an LCT diploma supplement.</p>

<p>The LCT Masters program has been successfully implemented since 2006, being funding by the Erasmus Mundus Programme from 2007 to 2011 and from 2013 to 2017. In 2012 the LCT Program operated as an Erasmus Mundus Brand Name. Intake 2019: the program commits to respecting the Erasmus
Mundus requirements and to maintain the high quality of the implementation during the years of funding. Applications will be accepted from self-funding students or students with alternative sources of funding.</p>
