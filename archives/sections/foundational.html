<h2 class="eacl-subheader">Constitution</h2>

The <a href=/contents/current.html>EACL Constitution</a> was ratified by the
the Chapter membership on 19 June 2001, and approved by the ACL Executive
Committee on 8 July 2001.

<p>

<h2 class="eacl-subheader">Foundation</h2>

<p>The EACL Foundation was established on 29 October 2003, with the official
seat in Groningen, The Netherlands. The official title of the foundation
is "Stichting European Chapter of the Association for Computational
Linguistics", or "Stichting EACL" for short. The motivation for the
foundation is to create a "European legal person" in order to allow EACL
to apply for grants to European funding bodies. </p>

<p>

Important points in the <a href="/contents/EACL-Foundation-exp.pdf">Foundation
Statutes</a> are:

<ul>

<li> The foundation board consists of the three primary officers of the
EACL, ex officio, the Chair, Secretary and Treasurer. </li>

<li> The EACL Advisory Board is an advisory committee to the foundation
board. </li>

<li> The foundation board must hold an annual meeting, not later than 6
months after the end of the financial year (which coincides with the
calendar year). Board meetings will be held in conjunction with Chapter
scientific meetings. </li>

<li> Before July 1 every year the foundation board must compile and all
sign a written financial statement covering the previous year, accompanied
by a report on the activities performed. </li>
</ul>

The EACL Board is very grateful to John Nerbonne for the work he has
done towards creating the foundation.
